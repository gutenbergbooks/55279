<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>

<p>The tricks described in the following pages are
of my own invention, and for the most part are entirely
new departures: not only the effects produced,
but the appliances by means of which they
are produced, being original.</p>

<p>From the nature of the case, it follows that few
of the items described have been submitted to the
supreme test of performance in public, but all have
been thoroughly thought out; most of the root-ideas
having in fact been simmering in my mind
for more than two years past. One or two of them
may demand a more than average amount of address
on the part of the performer; but the majority
are comparatively easy, and I believe I may
assert with confidence that all will be found both
practicable and effective. Should any of my modest
inventions be found, as is not improbable, susceptible
of further polish, the keen wits and ready
fingers of my brother wizards may safely be
trusted to supply it.</p>

<p>The items entitled <i>The Mystery of Mahomet</i>,
<i>The Bewildering Blocks</i>, and <i>The Wizard’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
Pocket-book</i>, have been described in the columns of
an English magical serial, but have never appeared
in book shape, and are by special desire, included
in the present volume.</p>

<p>A final word on a personal matter. Had I been
prophet, as well as magician, when I first began
to write on conjuring, I should have chosen a different
pen-name. In the light of later events, my
selection was unfortunate. My identity has long
been an open secret, but as I cannot flatter myself
that it is universally known, I take this opportunity
to assure all whom it may concern that I am
British to the backbone.</p>

<h1>LATEST MAGIC</h1>

<h2 id="INTRODUCTORY">INTRODUCTORY<br />
<span class="smaller">SOME NEW APPLIANCES OF GENERAL UTILITY</span></h2>

<p>The little appliances to be presently described
are the outcome of ideas which, after a long period
of incubation in my note-books, have ultimately
taken concrete form in what, I venture to believe,
will be found to be practical and useful items of
magical apparatus. I may further claim that they
combine in an exceptional degree absolute innocence
of appearance with a wide range of practical
utility. Examples of their uses are indicated in
the following pages, but the inventive reader will
find that these by no means exhaust their possibilities
of usefulness.</p>

<h3>MAGICAL MATS</h3>

<p>The first to be described are of two different
kinds, to be known as the “Card” and “Coin” Mat
respectively. They are in appearance simply circular
table&mdash;or plate mats, with an ornamental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
border as depicted in Fig. 1, and about seven inches
in diameter. In the centre of each is an embossed
shield, ostensibly a mere ornament, but in reality
serving, as will presently be seen, an important
practical purpose.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/figure1.jpg" width="300" height="100" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 1</span></p>
</div>

<p>To the casual observer the two mats look precisely
alike, but there are in reality important
practical differences between them. The “coin”
mat is covered with leather on both sides, and each
has the embossed shield, so that, whichever side is
uppermost, no difference is perceptible to the eye.
In the case of the “card” mat the upper surface
only is of leather, the under side being covered with
baize. The object of this difference is that the
exposure (accidental or otherwise) of the baize-covered
side of the card mat may induce in the
mind of the spectator the assumption that the
under side of the coin mat is covered in the same
way, such assumption naturally precluding the
idea that it is reversible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>Each mat has a secret space, after the manner of
the old “multiplying” salver, between its upper
and under surfaces. The opening in each case is
opposite the lower end or point of the shield before
mentioned, so that, however the mat may be placed,
a glance at the shield will always furnish a guide
to the position, for the time being, of the opening.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/figure2.jpg" width="300" height="300" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 2</span></p>
</div>

<p>In the case of the card mat the secret space (see
Fig. 2) is just large enough to accommodate three
playing cards, one upon another. The corresponding
space in the coin mat (Fig. 3) is shorter,
narrower and deeper, being designed to receive,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
one upon the other, a couple of half-crowns, or
coins of similar size.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/figure3.jpg" width="300" height="300" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 3</span></p>
</div>

<p>When required for use, the coin mat is prepared,
shortly beforehand, by rubbing the whole of the
space within the ornamental border on one of its
faces with diachylon, in the solid form. The
diachylon is used cold, the necessary friction melting
it sufficiently, without any additional heating.
This treatment renders the surface of the mat, for
the time being, adhesive, without in any way altering
its appearance. To make sure of its being just
right, press a half-crown or penny down firmly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
upon it, turn the mat over, and wave it about
freely. If the coin adheres securely, the mat is
in working order.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Where coins of English denominations are referred to in the text,
the American wizard will naturally replace them by corresponding coins
of the U. S. currency.</p>

</div>

</div>

<h3>THE FAIRY FLOWER-POTS</h3>

<p>These are, strictly speaking, only flower-pot
cases, called in French <i>cache-pots</i>. They may be
of leather or cardboard, ornamented on the outside,
but plain black inside, their general appearance
being as shown in Fig. 4. They have neither
top nor bottom, and when not in use, can be opened
out flat or rolled up as in Figs. 5 and 6, for greater
portability.</p>

</div>

<p>The pair, when needed for use, are exhibited in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
the first instance as one only, the one within the
other. The professedly single pot, after being
proved empty by exhibiting the interior and passing
the hand through it, is made into two, by simply
drawing out the inner one. The duplication
is not presented as a trick, the <i>modus operandi</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
being self-evident, but it has a pretty effect, and
the exhibiting of the two pots as one in the first
instance admits of the presence, within the outer
one, of a secret pocket, open at top, as depicted in
Fig. 7, but folding down, when not in use, flat
against its side.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The main object of this pocket is to enable the
performer to “vanish” a card. The card to be
got rid of is dropped ostensibly into the flower-pot,
or rather, the pot being bottomless, <i>through</i>
it on to the table, where, when the pot is lifted,
the spectators naturally expect to see it. It has
however disappeared, having in fact been dropped
into the pocket, where it remains concealed. Two,
or even three cards may on occasion be dealt with
in the same way. By covering the pocket with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
fingers in the act of picking up the pot, the interior
of the latter may be freely shown after their disappearance.</p>

<p>The pocket, previously loaded accordingly
(though the flower-pot is shown, to all appearance,
empty), may also be used for the production of a
card or cards.</p>

<h3>PATTER APPROPRIATE TO THE FAIRY
FLOWER-POTS</h3>

<p>The flower-pots may be introduced as follows:</p>

<p>“Permit me to call your attention to one of my
latest improvements. Conjurers have a foolish
fancy, as I dare say you have noticed, for borrowing
other people’s hats. If a conjurer wants to
collect money from the air, he collects it in a hat.
If he wants to make an omelette, he cooks it in a
hat. If he wants to hatch a few chickens, he does
it in a hat. And, for fear of accidents, he never
uses his own hat, but always borrows somebody
else’s. It’s very wrong of us. As Sir William
Gilbert says, about some other forms of crime,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘It’s human nature, P’raps. If so,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">O! isn’t human nature <i>low</i>.’</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But we all do it. The worst of it is, we get so in
the way of borrowing hats that we do it without
thinking. You will hardly believe that one evening
I came away from the theatre with two hats.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
One of them was my own. The other I had borrowed&mdash;from
under the seat. You don’t believe
it? Well, I said you wouldn’t. I always know!</p>

<p>“But that is not all. It isn’t only the bad effect
on the conjurer’s own morals, and sometimes on
the hat. People are so careless. They do leave
such funny things in their hats. Cannon balls and
birdcages; babies’ socks and babies’ bottles; rabbits
and pigeons, and bowls of fish, and a host of
other things. And just when you are going to produce
some brilliant effect, you are pulled up short
by finding some silly thing of that sort in the hat.
It’s most annoying.</p>

<p>“So, after thinking it over, I made up my mind
to do away with hats altogether. Of course I
don’t mean for putting on people’s heads, but so
far as conjuring is concerned, and it struck me
that a pretty flower-pot, like this, would form a
capital substitute.” (Show as one, the combined
pots, inside and out.) “Much nicer than a hat,
don’t you think? It is prettier, to begin with, and
then again, you can see right through it, and make
sure there is no deception. You see that at present
the pot is perfectly empty.</p>

<p>“But no! I scorn to deceive you. I am like
George Washington, except that I haven’t got a
little axe. I cannot tell a lie. At least it hurts
me very much to do so, and I don’t feel well enough
to do it now. No! It is useless any longer to disguise
it! The pot is <i>not</i> really empty, for you see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
here is another inside it.” (Produce second pot.)
“You wouldn’t have thought it, would you? In
fact, you would never have known, if I hadn’t told
you.</p>

<p>“Of course I could keep on doing this all the
evening, but there wouldn’t be much fun in it, and
no time would be left for anything else, so I will
proceed at once to make use of the pots for a little
experiment with cards.”</p>

<p>(Proceed with any trick for which the card mat
may have been prepared.)</p>

<p>N. B. It will be taken for granted, in the
description of tricks dependent upon the use of the
flower-pots, that these have been already introduced,
after the above or some similar manner.</p>

<h3>ADHESIVE CARDS AND TRICKS THEREWITH</h3>

<p>I believe I may safely claim that the device I
am about to describe was, until I disclosed it some
months ago in the <i>Magazine of Magic</i>, an absolute
novelty. It consists in the preparation of one card
of a pack (or, better still, of a spare card, to be
substituted at need for its double), by rubbing one
or other of its surfaces, shortly before it is needed
for use, with diachylon, in the solid form.</p>

<p>We will suppose, in the first instance, that the
<i>back</i> of the card is so dealt with. The rubbing
does not alter its appearance, but gives it a thin
coating of adhesive matter, and if another card is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
pressed against the surface so treated, the two
adhere, and for the time become, in effect, one card
only, viz., the one whose face is exposed, the other
having temporarily disappeared from the pack.</p>

<p>This renders possible many striking effects. To
take an elementary example, let us suppose that
the old-fashioned flat card-box, or some other
appliance for magically producing a card, is
loaded with, say, a seven of diamonds. The corresponding
card is forced on one of the company,
and taken back into the middle of the pack, on
the top of the prepared card. The performer does
not disturb or tamper with the pack in the smallest
degree. He merely squares up the cards, and,
pressing them well together, hands them to be
shuffled, meanwhile calling attention to the card-box,
which is shown apparently empty. He then
asks the name of the drawn card, announcing that
it will at his command leave the pack and find its
way into the box.</p>

<p>He now counts off the cards, showing the face
of each as he does so, and leaving it exposed upon
the table. The seven of diamonds has disappeared,
being in fact hidden behind the prepared
card, which we will suppose to be in this instance
the queen of clubs.</p>

<p>Leaving the cards outspread upon the table, the
performer opens the card-box, and shows that the
missing card has somehow found its way into it.</p>

<p>In the hands of a novice, the trick might end at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
this point; but even a novice may very well carry
it a stage further. To do so, he will in the first
place replace the card in the box, in such a manner
that it can be again “vanished.” In gathering
together the outspread cards, he takes care to place
the queen of clubs on top of the rest. As this,
however, is the double card, the actual top card is
of course the missing seven of diamonds. It is
an easy matter, in handling the cards, to detach
this from the queen of clubs, and, after a little
“talkee-talkee,” show that it has left the box and
returned to the pack.</p>

<p>The above would, however, be much too crude
and elementary a proceeding to commend itself to
the expert. In the trick next to be described the
same expedient is employed after a more subtle
fashion.</p>

<h3>THE MISSING CARD</h3>

<p>The requirements for this trick consist of two
complete packs of cards and an extra card, which
we will suppose to be the knave of diamonds. One
of the two packs, which we will call <i>A</i>, has on top
a card made adhesive at the back as above
described, and its own knave of diamonds at the
bottom. The other pack, <i>B</i>, is wholly unprepared.</p>

<p>The first step is to offer pack <i>B</i> to be shuffled,
and when it is returned to palm on to it the spare
knave of diamonds, after which the pack is left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
temporarily for the time being in view on the table.
The next step is to pick up pack <i>A</i>, and force from
it the knave of diamonds, receiving it back on top of
the prepared card, passed to the middle of the pack
for its reception. Squaring up the pack and
applying the necessary pressure, the performer
offers it to be shuffled, meanwhile delivering himself
to something like the following effect.</p>

<p>“Before going further, ladies and gentlemen,
I want you to remember exactly what has been
done. A card has been chosen from this pack. It
has been put back again, the cards have been
shuffled, and you can all bear witness that I have
not touched them since. Nobody knows, except
the lady who chose it, what card she chose.
Whereabouts in the pack it may be at this moment
not one of us knows, even the lady herself. I can
assure you truthfully that <i>I</i> don’t, but I propose,
by force of magic, to compel that card, whatever it
may be, to leave that pack altogether, and pass into
the other one. Nay, more than that, I shall compel
it to place itself at any number in that pack
you like to name. What shall we say? Seventh?
Good.</p>

<p>“Now please bear in mind that that pack, like
the other, has just been shuffled, and that I have
not touched it since. It is therefore manifestly
impossible that I should know the position of any
card in it. Of course, as there is already a knave
of diamonds in the pack, it is just possible, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
scarcely likely, that that card may have been
shuffled into the seventh place. We will see.”</p>

<p>He counts off cards from the top of the pack on
to the table, <i>faces down</i>, not exposing any card till
he comes to the seventh, which he holds up so that
all may see it. “Now, Madam, is that your card?
I don’t want to know the name of it yet. It is not
your card? I did not suppose it was, for the
chances were over fifty to one against it, but you
never can tell!”</p>

<p>He gathers up the cards counted off, and without
disturbing their order, replaces them on the top
of the pack, thereby bringing the original top card
to the seventh place.</p>

<p>“Now please observe that I do not touch these
cards again till the miracle has actually happened.
I will now ask you, madam, to be good enough to
name your card. The knave of diamonds, you
say? That is all right. Had you taken the knave
of clubs, I should have feared for the success of
my experiment, for that knave always gives
trouble, if he can; but the knave of diamonds is a
very gentlemanly card, and I have no doubt that
he will readily oblige. Now, Percy (perhaps you
didn’t know his name was Percy), I want you to
leave the pack you are in, and place yourself seventh
in the other pack. Go at once, like a good
boy. Start at the top, and go straight down.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven!</p>

<p>“I should think he has arrived by this time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Let us make sure first, though, whether he has
really left the other pack.”</p>

<p>Picking up pack <i>A</i>, he counts the cards slowly,
not looking at them himself, but showing the face
of each before laying it on the table. “Stop me,
please, if you see the knave of diamonds.” He
counts, “one, two, three, four,” and so on to the
end. “Fifty-one cards only! Then there is one
card missing, and as you have not seen the knave
of diamonds, and as all the other cards are here, it
is plain that it is he who has left the pack. We
have still to find out whether he has obeyed orders,
and gone over to the other pack. You wished him
to place himself seventh, I think. I won’t touch
the cards myself. Will some gentleman come forward,
and count them off for me?” (This is
done.) “The seventh card is really the knave of
diamonds, is it not?</p>

<p>“But, you may say, this might be the knave
properly belonging to this pack. Please look
through the pack, sir, and if there has been no
deception you will find the proper knave in some
other part of it. You have found the other knave?
Then you will admit that that proves clearly that
this first one is the identical card the lady drew.”<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>It would be easy to give other combinations
dependent on the use of the adhesive principle, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
these may safely be left to the ingenuity of the
reader. If the face, instead of the back, of a given
card be treated with the adhesive, that card will
itself disappear from the pack. By due adjustment
two adhering cards may (the one slightly
overlapping the other) be made to form a temporary
long or wide card.</p>

<h2 id="NOVEL_APPLICATIONS_OF_THE">NOVEL APPLICATIONS OF THE “BLACK ART” PRINCIPLE</h2>

<h3>BLACK ART MATS AND BLACK ART PATCHES</h3>

<p>The Black Art Table has long since established
itself in the affections of the conjurer as one of his
most effective aids. At a stage performance the
presence of one or more such adjuncts is almost a
matter of course, but the drawing room performer
finds many occasions when, for one reason or
another, the use of such an aid is precluded.
Some wizards, as a matter of personal convenience,
decline to burden themselves with more artistic
luggage than can be bestowed in an ordinary handbag.
Others, again, hold (and not without reason)
that the use of a special table, imported by
the performer himself, tends to discount the marvel
of his show; as being suggestive of that “preparation”
which every artistic conjurer is anxious to
disclaim. It is no doubt an easy matter to arrange
a good enough programme for which the aid of
“black art” is not needed, but this means the
exclusion not merely of a valuable auxiliary, but
of many of the most striking magical effects.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/figure8.jpg" width="450" height="200" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 8</span></p>
</div>

<p>I have pleasure in introducing to the reader a
substitute which, though its capabilities fall a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
deal short of those of the actual table, will answer
many of its purposes, apart from special merits of
its own, and which has the further recommendation
of exceptional portability. It may be appropriately
entitled the Black Art Mat. It consists
of a piece of Bristol board of size and shape suitable
to the purpose for which it is to be used, covered
on both sides with black velvet and edged with
narrow ornamental braid or binding. The one
side has no speciality, but the other has a flat
pocket across one or more of its corners; as indicated
in Fig. 8. In the case of a mat of small size
the pocket may extend diagonally from corner to
corner as in Fig. 9. The edge of the pocket may be
braided if preferred (the rest of the surface being
ornamented to correspond) but if the mat be well
made this is not necessary. The mouth of each
pocket is made slightly “full,” and is held open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
a quarter of an inch or so by means of a stiffening
along its inner edge. By having the mill-board
foundation cut in half before it is covered, the mat
may be made to fold like a chessboard for greater
portability.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/figure9.jpg" width="450" height="200" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 9</span></p>
</div>

<p>If some small article, say a coin or ring, is laid
on mat just behind the mouth of the pocket, it may
be made to disappear therein, being in fact swept
into the pocket in the act of apparently picking it
up. In the case of a coin, the pocket may by a
slight alteration of procedure be used to effect a
“change”; a substitute, palmed beforehand, being
exhibited in place of the one professedly picked up
from the mat.</p>

<p>It is desirable when placing the mat upon the
table for use to see that the mouth of the pocket
is duly open and has not been, by any accident,
pressed flat, and so closed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>The utility of the black art mat, however, does
not depend upon the pocket only. Its unbroken or
“plain” side, or indeed a mat wholly without
pockets may also be very effectively used for vanishing
purposes. In this case a little auxiliary
appliance comes into play. This is a small velvet
patch, serving as an “overlay.” It may be round
or square, according to the purpose for which it is
intended to be used. For coin-vanishing purposes
it is best circular, and about two inches (or less,
as the case may be) in diameter. The foundation
is in this case a disc of thin card covered on both
sides with velvet, in colour and texture <i>exactly corresponding
with that of the mat</i>, under which conditions
the patch, when laid on the mat, will be
invisible. The exact similarity of the two surfaces
is a point of the highest importance for black art
effects, and the velvet used, if not actually silk velvet,
should at least be of the silk-faced kind. Velvet
which is all cotton will never give satisfactory
results.</p>

<p>If a coin be laid on any part of the mat the
performer has only (in the supposed act of picking
it up) to lay the velvet patch over it to render it
invisible. If it is desired to reproduce the coin, a
handkerchief shown to be empty, may be laid over
the patch, and a moment or two later picked up
again, bringing away the overlay within it, and
again revealing the coin <i>in statu quo</i>. A practical
example of the use of this device will be found in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
the case of the trick entitled <i>Lost and Found</i>, <i>post</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/figure10.jpg" width="200" height="200" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 10</span></p>
</div>

<p>Another little device which will be found useful
in connection with the black art mat is a cardboard
disc covered as above, to one side of which a coin,
say a half-crown or half-dollar, is cemented as in
Fig. 10. Such a patch, laid on the mat, coin side
down, will attract no notice, but the mere act of
turning it over will at any given moment produce
the coin. The “change” of a coin may be expected
very neatly by the aid of this device. Suppose,
for example, that the performer desires to retain,
unknown to the spectators, possession of a marked
coin just handed to him. He lays it, to all appearance,
in full view upon the table, but as a matter
of fact merely turns over a patch, loaded as above,
already on the table, the borrowed coin remaining
in his hand.</p>

<p>The velvet patch may also be utilised in another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
way for “changing” a borrowed coin. The performer,
asking the loan of a marked coin, brings
forward held in his left hand a velvet mat (of small
size) whereon to receive it; the right hand meanwhile
holding palmed against the second and third
fingers the velvet patch, and between this and the
hand a substitute coin of similar kind. Turning
(to the left) towards his table, with the coin in full
view on the mat, he (apparently) picks it up and
holds it aloft with the right hand, placing the
now empty mat alone on the table. What he
really does is to lay the velvet patch over the borrowed
coin and to pick the substitute in its place.
The original lies <i>perdu</i> on the mat, whence it is
child’s play to gain possession of it at any later
stage of the trick.</p>

<p>The process may be varied by placing the mat,
after receiving the borrowed coin upon it, at once
on the table, and a little later picking up the mat
with the left hand, then proceeding as above indicated.
The advantage of this plan is that the turn
to the table to pick up the mat masks for the
moment the right side of the performer and gives
him a convenient opportunity to palm the coin and
patch, bestowed in readiness in the <i>pochette</i> on
that side.</p>

<p>The same principle may be applied with appropriate
modifications to card tricks. The idea of
the black art mat is so completely a novelty that I
have not found leisure to give it the full consideration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
it deserves, and have probably far from
exhausted its possibilities, but I offer by way of
illustration the trick next following, which it seems
to me would be rather effective, particularly as an
introduction to some other card trick. We will
call it</p>

<h3>A MAGICAL TRANSPOSITION</h3>

<p>Prepare two cards, say an eight of hearts and a
seven of spades, by blackening all their edges save
one of the narrow ends,<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and backing each with
velvet matching the mat. Lay the two cards so
treated face down with the white edge towards
yourself on the mat at some little distance apart,
or preferably on separate mats. Force corresponding
cards on two members of the company
and deliver an oration to something like the following
effect:</p>

<p>“We hear people talk sometimes about the
quickness of the hand deceiving the eye. I suppose
such a thing must be possible, or nobody
would have thought of it, but it seems to me that if
it did anything of the kind, either the hand must be
extra quick, or the eye extra slow. I know I should
be afraid to attempt anything of that sort myself,
but if you are a magician of the right sort you have
no need to do so, for you can deceive the eye without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
any quickness at all. I will prove it to you by
means of these two cards which have been chosen.
Please give me one of them. I don’t mind which.”</p>

<p>We will suppose that the card handed up is the
eight of hearts.</p>

<p>“Notice please what card this is; the eight of
hearts. You can’t possibly mistake it for any
other card, can you? I will turn it down here on
the table. And now for the other card.” (It is
held up that all may see it.) “This one, you see,
is the seven of spades. No mistake about that,
either! I will lay that one here.” The card is in
each case laid upon the velvet-covered card of the
opposite kind.</p>

<p>“Please don’t forget which is which. There has
been no quickness of the hand so far, has there?
Now I am going to make these two cards change
places.” (You touch each with the wand.)
“Presto, change!” (Picking up the upper and
lower cards exactly one upon the other you show
what was a moment previously the eight of hearts,
but which now appears to be the seven of spades.)
“One card has changed, you see. And now for
the other.” (You show the other pair after the
same fashion.) “And here we have the eight of
hearts. I will now order them to change back
again.” You lay both pairs again face down.</p>

<p>“Now I again give the cards a touch with my
wand, and say ‘Right about! Change!’ and now,
you see” (showing the faces of the original cards),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
“they have returned to their original positions.</p>

<p>“Now you will realise, if you think about the
matter, that those two cards couldn’t in any natural
way change places without your seeing them
do it, neither could the one change into the other.
But this is where magic comes in. What I really
did was to hypnotise you a little so as to make you
fancy, when I told the cards to change, that the
eight of hearts was the seven of spades, and that
the seven of spades was the eight of hearts. It’s
quite simple, when you know it, and you can see
for yourselves that the quickness of the hand has
had nothing to do with the matter. For my own
part I like to do things slowly; the more slowly
the better, and then you can all see how it’s done.”</p>

<p>The trick is simple enough; but it will test the
performer’s expertness as to neatness of execution.
He must be careful in the first place to put
each of the drawn cards as exactly as possible on
the opposite velvet-backed card; and in picking up
two cards together he should frame them, so to
speak, between the middle finger and thumb at top
and bottom, and the first and third fingers at the
sides. Held in this manner they rest squarely one
upon the other and there is little fear of their
“duplicity” (or “duplexity”) being perceived.
In the act of again turning the double card down
the upper one should be partially drawn off the
one below it; this facilitating the picking of it up
alone a few moments later.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>An illustration of the use of the same device
in a somewhat different form will be found in the
item next described, and in the trick entitled
<i>“Where is it?” post</i>. Other ways of using it will
suggest themselves to any reader of an inventive
turn.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_4" id="Footnote_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> Better still, thicken the under edge by the interposition between
card and velvet of a slip of white card, as described in <i>The Detective
Die, post.</i></p>

<h3>THE DETECTIVE DIE</h3>

<p>This is another of the new departures dependent
upon the use of the velvet mat. Broadly stated,
the effect of the trick is as follows.</p>

<p>One of a group of six different cards laid out in
a row or rows repeatedly changes place with some
other, the position which it occupies, or to which it
has moved, being indicated by the cast of an ordinary
die. This may be repeated any number of
times.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>The requirements for the trick are as follows:</p>

<p>1. The Velvet Mat. This should be one with
a plain surface, dimensions preferably eighteen
inches by ten, so as to admit of the six cards being
laid in one row. A smaller size, say twelve by
nine, may suffice, the six cards in this case being
arranged in two rows. In either case there must
be a space of an inch or so between each pair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>2. Six cards of like denomination (say for the
purpose of illustration six queens of diamonds),
each backed with black velvet and blackened at the
edges all around save at one end. Here the card is
thickened by the interposition of a slip of white
cardboard between itself and the velvet, so that the
card as viewed from that end shall show a clearly
visible white edge. Each card has all four of its
corners snipped off to a microscopic extent, say a
sixteenth, or less, of an inch.</p>

<p>3. An ordinary pack of cards one of which (in
the case supposed, the queen of diamonds) bears a
mark upon its back recognisable by the performer,
but not conspicuous enough to be noticed by any
one else.</p>

<p>4. An ordinary die and dice-box, or a champagne
tumbler to be used in place of the latter.</p>

<p>5. A tray or plate, about six inches in diameter,
whereon to throw the die.</p>

<p>6. The wand.</p>

<p><i>Preparation.</i> Velvet mat on table, and laid
upon it, face down in a row (or a double row, in
the case of a small mat), the six velvet-backed
cards. These, so laid, will be undistinguishable by
spectators at a very short distance from the mat
itself. Each is laid with its “white” end toward
the hinder part of the table, so that this shall be
visible to the performer when standing behind it.
The marked queen of diamonds is laid on the top
of the pack. The die and dice-box, on their tray,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
are laid on the mat, which may partially cover two
or more of the six cards.</p>

<p><i>Presentation.</i> Performer, picking up the pack
of cards with his right hand, transfers it to his left,
leaving the queen of diamonds palmed in the right.
Picking up the tray and its contents with the right
hand and advancing with it, he offers the pack to
some member of the company, saying: “Will you
kindly look well over this pack of cards and satisfy
yourself that there is nothing exceptional about
them; and when you have done so give them a
thorough shuffle. And you, Sir” (handing tray
and die to another spectator), “please test this die
in any way your please. Throw it as many times
as you like. I want you to be quite sure that it
throws a different number each time, and that it is
not loaded, or ‘faked’ in any way.</p>

<p>“I don’t like bothering people to examine things,
for in most cases it is a mere waste of time. But in
this case I have a special reason for asking. There
is something about this pack of cards and this die
which I myself don’t understand; and I shall be
much obliged to anyone who will help me to do so.
As a matter of fact, these cards, though quite ordinary
in other respects, are afflicted with a peculiar
restlessness. They change places without notice
and without any apparent reason. If I were to
try to play bridge with them, for instance, I should
find as likely as not that my best trump had invisibly
left my hand and passed over to the enemy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
which would naturally upset my game and get me
into trouble with my partner. The die is equally
peculiar, but in another way. From some curious
effect of sympathy it knows where a given card
is to be found when I don’t know myself.</p>

<p>“The only possible explanation I can think of
for their peculiarities is the fact that both cards
and die were formerly the property of an old
magician, and that after his death they were shut
up together for some years in the same box with
this wand, which also belonged to him, and that
they have imbibed some of its magical qualities.
I will give you a sample of their ‘eccentricities.’”</p>

<p>Performer takes back the cards and proceeds to
force the queen of diamonds on some member of
the company (a lady for choice). Leaving the
drawn card for the time being in her hands, he
asks a gentleman to shuffle and cut the rest of the
pack and count off from the cut five indifferent
cards. The card drawn by the lady is then shuffled
with these, so that its position among the six shall
be unknown. Performer, taking these from the
holder, deals them in a row (or double row, as the
case may be) upon the velvet mat, placing each
exactly over one of the velvet-backed cards; the
white hinder edges of these guiding him as to their
positions.</p>

<p>“We will now consider these cards as numbered
in regular order, One, Two, Three, Four, Five,
Six! Among them somewhere or other, is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
card the lady chose. At what number it stands
nobody knows (I can assure you that I don’t), but
the die will tell us instantly. May I ask you,
Madam, to name your card. The queen of diamonds;
you say? Good! Now will the gentleman
who holds the die kindly throw it. What is
the number thrown? A three?” (Whatever the
number happens to be.) “The die says the card
stands number three. Let us see whether that is
correct.”</p>

<p>He picks up the two cards occupying the position
indicated, and shows the face of the undermost,
which is of course seen to be the queen of
diamonds.</p>

<p>“But now we come to the more remarkable feature
of the case. I told you about the queer way in
which the cards change places. Even in this short
time I daresay the lady’s card has got tired of
being number three, and has moved away to some
other number. If so, the die will tell us. Throw
it again, Sir, please.”</p>

<p>This is done, the die bringing up a new number,
say “five.”</p>

<p>“The die declares that the card has moved, and
now stands fifth. We shall soon see whether such
is really the case. First, however, let us see
whether it has really departed from number
three.”</p>

<p>Performer has meanwhile replaced the two
cards just lifted. He now lifts the upper one only,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
which (being one of the indifferent cards) shows
a different face. “The queen has gone, you see.
And now to ascertain whether she has really
passed to number five.”</p>

<p>The two cards standing at that number are lifted
together, and again a queen of diamonds is exhibited.
The trick can of course be repeated any
number of times, but it is better not to prolong it
beyond a third or fourth “move.”</p>

<p>In picking up two cards together, in order to
show the undermost, they are lifted with second
finger at top, thumb at bottom and the first and
third fingers at the sides. Thus “framed” so to
speak, the two cards will lie squarely the one upon
the other and be undistinguishable from a single
card. When it is desired to lift the upper card
alone, it should be nipped between the second finger
at top right-hand corner and thumb at bottom
left-hand corner, when it will be brought away
clear without difficulty.</p>

<p>There is one contingency for which the performer
must be prepared, namely, that the throw
of the die may happen to correspond with the
actual position of the card drawn. Both cards of
the pair are in this case alike, and the performer
cannot, at the succeeding throw, show that the
drawn card is no longer in its late position. This
possibility is provided for by having the back of
the card marked as before explained. Should the
contingency in question arise, the performer, having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
meanwhile noted the marked card, does not call
attention to the disappearance of the queen from
that number, but proceeds at once to show that it
has moved to its new position. There is not the
smallest fear that anyone will notice the omission.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_5" id="Footnote_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> Since the description which follows was written, it has come to my
knowledge that there is already on sale a trick on somewhat similar
lines in point of <i>effect</i> entitled <i>The Educated Die</i>. I need hardly say
that my own trick, so far as I am concerned, is absolutely original. The
advertised description of <i>The Educated Die</i> would suit either trick, but
there is little further resemblance between them.</p>

<h3>THE DISSOLVING DICE</h3>

<p><i>To be worked on a Black Art Table</i></p>

<p>The requisites for this trick are as under:</p>

<p>1. Three small billiard balls, one red, two white.</p>

<p>2. A white half-shell to correspond, vested or
placed in a pochette.</p>

<p>3. Three hollow wooden dice, each of such a size
as just to contain one of the balls, and lined inside
with velvet to prevent “talking.” One side of
each is left open, but the opening can be closed
at pleasure by the insertion of a loose side with a
beveled edge. When this is in position, the die
appears solid. The inner surface of each of the
loose sides is also covered with black velvet, so that
when lying with that side upwards on a black art
table it is practically invisible.</p>

<p>4. Three cardboard covers, fitting easily over
the dice. In preparation for the trick the three
balls are placed inside the dice, and these are
placed on the table, open side upward, but with the
loose sides inserted on top, and the covers over
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Presentation.</i> The opening “yarn” may run as
follows:</p>

<p>“I once read a story about a man who invented
a most ingenious piece of furniture of the ‘combination’
kind. It started, say, as a table, but by
giving it a pull here and a push there, it became a
step-ladder. Another pull and push, and it turned
into a mangle, or by just turning a button or two,
you could make it a clothes-horse.</p>

<p>“The story says that at first it was a great success,
but after a little while the thing began to work
too easily, and sometimes changed of its own
accord when least expected, which was a drawback.
It was annoying, naturally, when you were using
it as a step-ladder, and hanging up a picture, to
have it suddenly turn into a clothes-horse, and land
you on the floor. It was vexing, too, when it was
a table, and the family were seated round it at
breakfast, to have it turn into a mangle, and mangle
the cups and saucers.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t care myself to have a piece of furniture
like that: it would make life too exciting.
But the story gave me an idea. It struck me what
a convenience it would be, after showing one of my
little experiments, to be able to turn the articles I
had been using into what I wanted for the next. I
haven’t got very far as yet, but I have made a
beginning in a small way, and I will show you how
it’s done.</p>

<p>“I have here three wooden dice, with a cover for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
each of them.” (Take off all three covers, placing
each beside its own die. Then, placing one of them
on the end of your wand, advance with it to the
company, tacitly inviting anyone who pleases to
take it off and examine it.) “I use these covers
to spare the feelings of the dice at the critical
moment. Like myself, they are rather bashful.
They don’t mind doing the Jekyll and Hyde business,
but they don’t like to be seen doing it. By
the way, there is a very ancient trick (believed to
have been invented by Noah in the Ark, to amuse
the boys on a wet Sunday), which is worked by
means of a sham die fitting over the real one.
Please take my word for it that I do not use any
such stale device. If I did, you may be quite sure
I should not mention it. These are all three genuine
dice. They are rather too large to play backgammon
with, but save as to size, they are merely
big brothers of the regular article. Most of you
know, no doubt, that in properly made dice, the
points on opposite sides always together make
seven. Notice please, that each of these dice has
the numbers placed correctly.” (Taking up one
of the dice and turning it about.) “You see, five
on this side, two on that; together, seven. Three
on this side, four on that; together, seven. Six on
this side, one on that; again seven.”</p>

<p>This is repeated, in a casual way, with the other
two dice, the object being two-fold, viz.: first, by
showing all six sides, to induce the belief that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
dice are solid, and secondly, to enable the performer,
in replacing them on the table, to turn each
the other way up, so as to bring the loose side
undermost. This is best done by placing the
thumb on top of the die, with the first and second
fingers behind it, then tilting the die over a little
to the front, and slipping the two fingers underneath
it. After showing it on all sides, as above
mentioned, it is an easy matter to replace it with
the loose side undermost, as desired.</p>

<p>“Now, as it happens, I have no immediate use for
dice, but I want to show you a pretty little effect
with billiard-balls. Naturally, the thing to be
done is to change the dice into billiard-balls. It’s
quite easy, if you are provided with my patent
quick-change combination dice. All you need to
think about is to take care to have even numbers
in front.” (You turn the dice accordingly, and in
so doing lift each die a little, and shift it forward
a couple of inches or so, leaving the loose side
undisturbed just behind it, the ball travelling forward
with the die, though still covered by it.)
“You don’t see why they should show even numbers?
Because they would look ‘odd’ if they
didn’t. Quite simple,&mdash;when you know it. Now
I cover all three dice over, to spare their blushes,
as I explained just now. I wave my wand over
them and say, ‘Presto! Proximo! Change!’
And we shall find the dice have all turned to billiard-balls.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>The right hand lifts the first cover, pressing its
sides sufficiently to lift the die within it, exposing
the ball, and in bringing it down again lands it
close to one of the wells of the table. The exposed
ball is picked up with the left hand, and while the
attention of the company is attracted in that direction,
the die is allowed to slide out of its case into
the well, after which the ball and cover are brought
forward and handed to someone of the company.</p>

<p>The other two balls are now uncovered in the
same way, but in this case the dice may be left in
their covers, the offer of the first cover, found
empty as above, having sufficiently proved that
they really disappear.</p>

<p>“Well, we have got our three billiard-balls.
Good, so far. Next, can any gentleman oblige me
with the loan of a billiard table? Nobody offers:
that’s unfortunate. Well, does any gentleman
happen to have a cue about him. No again?
Well, perhaps it would be ‘cuerious’ if any gentleman
had. I beg your pardon, it slipped out
unawares. It shall not occur again.</p>

<p>“It’s unfortunate that I can’t borrow a billiard
table and a cue, because it prevents my showing
you my celebrated break of ninety-three off the
red with my eyes shut. When I showed it to Gray,
he turned green, but that is another story. You
don’t believe it? Well, I told you it was a story.</p>

<p>“Anyhow, as we have got the balls, we must do
something with them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>The sequel may vary, according to the fancy of
the performer, and his skill in ball-conjuring.
For lack of a more effective <i>dénouement</i>, the trick
may be brought to a finish as follows:</p>

<p>Secretly getting the shell ball into his right
hand, and picking up the red ball with the left,
the performer proceeds:</p>

<p>“Well, here we have three balls, one red and two
white. To prevent ill feeling between them, I
think we had better make them all the same colour:
and as the white are in the majority, we will have
them all white. It is quite easy, if you know how
to do it. You have only to breathe on the ball,
give it a roll round in the hand to take the colour
off, and there you are.”</p>

<p>After breathing on the ball, you bring the right
hand containing the shell over it, and exhibit it,
shell in front. You then transfer it in the same
condition, to the opposite hand. Then pick up one
of the two white balls with the right hand, transfer
it to the left and show the two side by side. Then
pick up and add the third ball, in so doing letting
the red ball fall into the right hand, and while
calling attention to the three in the opposite hand,
drop it into the profonde. You then bring up the
shell over one or other of the two solid white balls,
thereby transforming the three into two. Drop
the solid from the shell into the right hand, making
the two into one; finally causing the disappearance
of this last after the usual manner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>If the reader (being an expert) is provided with
a spare red ball and red shell, he may offer the
choice as to which shall be the colour of all three,
finally causing their disappearance after the manner
above described, or his own version thereof.</p>

<h3>WHERE IS IT?</h3>

<p>This is another of the tricks dependent on the
novel application of the black art principle.</p>

<p>For programme purposes the trick may, if preferred,
be entitled “The Erratic Shilling.” Its
effect may be broadly described as follows:</p>

<p>A marked shilling, lent by some member of the
company, after being professedly magnetised or
mesmerised by rubbing, is laid upon a black velvet
mat and covered with a playing card, face down.
Two other cards are laid (also faces down), one on
each side of the first, at a few inches distance from
it, and the audience are given to understand that
the rubbing has imparted to the coin the power to
travel from card to card at command, and indeed
sometimes of its own accord. When the card
which covered the coin is lifted, this is found to be
the case. The shilling is no longer where first seen,
but is found to have placed itself under one of the
other two cards. The spectators may be invited
to say under which of the cards they would like the
coin to pass, when it will place itself accordingly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
The coin may be identified by the owner in the
course of the trick, as well as at its close.</p>

<p>The requirements for the trick are as follows:</p>

<p>1. The velvet mat.</p>

<p>2. A pack of cards, arranged as presently to
be explained.</p>

<p>3. Three overlays (<a href="#Page_20">see p. 20</a>), each consisting, in
the present instance, of a court card, backed with
velvet of similar tint and texture to that with
which the mat is covered. Three of the edges of
each card are blackened, but the fourth (one of its
shorter sides) is left white, and thickened by the
insertion of an extra slip of white card along that
end. The effect of this is that, as the card lies
on the mat, its white edge is visible from that side,
but from no other position.</p>

<p>4. Three cards, corresponding with the three
overlays, which we will suppose to represent the
queen of clubs, and the knaves of spades and diamonds
respectively. The queen is wholly unprepared,
but each of the two knaves has a point of
fine wire, or a black bristle projecting a sixteenth
of an inch or so, midway from each of its sides.
The “queen” overlay is furnished with similar
points, the object of these being to enable the performer
the more easily to lift a given card with or
without its duplicate overlay.</p>

<p>In preparing for the trick the two “knave”
overlays, each covering a shilling, are laid beforehand
on the mat, velvet side up, eight or ten inches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
apart, as shown in Fig. 11, under which circumstances
they are invisible to the spectators at a few
feet distance, and very nearly so to the performer,
save that their white edges, turned towards himself,
furnish him with an exact guide to their position.
On the top of the pack are laid, first the two
knaves. On these the queen overlay, and uppermost
the unprepared queen.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/figure11.jpg" width="400" height="160" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 11</span></p>
</div>

<p>In presenting the trick the borrowed shilling
is laid on the mat midway between the two
overlays already on the table, and is covered with
the top card of the pack, the third overlay being
lifted off with it, and resting beneath it with its
centre as nearly as possible over the coin.</p>

<p>The two following cards are now laid one on each
side of the first, as in Fig. 12, each on the corresponding
overlay, the white edges of these, visible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
to the performer, but not to the company, serving
as guides to exact position. When the performer
desires to show that the coin is not under a given
card, he raises the card only, lifting it lengthwise,
and leaving the coin covered by the overlay.
When he desires to exhibit a coin, he picks up the
card covering it breadthwise between finger and
thumb and with it the overlay beneath it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/figure12.jpg" width="400" height="160" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 12</span></p>
</div>

<p>The introductory patter may run as follows:</p>

<p>“You have all heard, no doubt, of what is called
the thimblerig trick, frequently exhibited at fairs
and on race-courses. Some of you gentlemen may
even have parted with a little money over it. For
the benefit of the ladies I will explain what it is.</p>

<p>“The operator has before him on a small board
or tray three thimbles, or half walnut-shells. He
exhibits a small pea, or a pellet the size of a pea,
which he affectionately calls the ‘joker.’ This he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
places under one of the thimbles, all three of which
he then shifts about on the tray; inviting the spectators
to bet with him as to which thimble the pea
is under. He has two or three confederates, who
bet, and naturally win, but if an outsider is rash
enough to back his own supposed smartness he
loses; for as a matter of fact the pea is not placed
under either of the thimbles at all until after the
bet is made, when it is skilfully introduced under
whichever thimble best suits the performer.</p>

<p>“The trick is in truth a mere affair of dexterity;
the performer having acquired by long practise
the power of placing the pea under any thimble
he pleases. What I propose to show you is a similar
effect, but more surprising, because, as you will
see, there is no room for dexterity, or indeed any
form of trickery; so that I have to depend entirely
upon my magic power. I shall use a shilling, as
being more easily seen than a pea, and three cards
from this pack to represent the thimbles.</p>

<p>“Will some gentleman oblige me with the loan
of a shilling; marked in such a way that he may
be sure of knowing it again.”</p>

<p>Receiving the coin in his right hand, the performer
makes believe to transfer it to his left;
wherein he already has a shilling of his own.
Surreptitiously depositing the coin lent to him
behind the pack of cards on the table, he exhibits
the substitute on the palm of the left hand and rubs
it with the fingers of the right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>“I do this,” he explains, “in order to drive out
all adverse magnetisms, and to substitute my own.
I will now put the coin in full view on the table
and cover it with a card. See that I do so fairly.”</p>

<p>After laying down the coin he takes the top card
of the pack, and with it, unknown to the spectators,
the overlay beneath it, and lowers them on to
the coin.</p>

<p>“Notice particularly, please, where I have
placed the coin, and notice too that I do not touch
it again. I will now place two more cards, one on
each side of the first one.” He does so, letting the
spectators see clearly that there is nothing in the
hand save the card itself, and then slowly lowering
it exactly on to one of the two overlays on the
table. “Now I make a few magnetic passes over
the cards, so.” He waves his wand backwards and
forwards above the cards, at a few inches’ distance.</p>

<p>“And now, where is the coin? Still under the
middle card, you would say? You are mistaken.”
He lifts that card lengthwise, leaving the overlay
covering the coin; then replacing the card. “It is
no longer there, you see. In point of fact it has
passed under this card.”</p>

<p>He lifts one of the side cards breadthwise, the
overlay coming with it, and exposes the coin
beneath it. “Here it is, you see. We will try
once more.” He replaces the card and then shows,
in like manner, that the coin has passed to the
card on the opposite side. After one or two transpositions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
have been shown, the audience being
allowed to say under which card the coin shall
appear, and the last shift having been to one of
the side positions, the performer says: “I should
like you to be satisfied that it is really the marked
coin and no other, that wanders about in this way.
I will ask the gentleman who lent it to me to verify
his mark.”</p>

<p>He picks up from one of the side positions the
coin last uncovered and brings it forward, but in
transit “switches” it for the borrowed coin, which
he has a moment previously picked up from its
resting place behind the pack. It is, of course,
this last which he offers for identification, again
exchanging it for the substitute before replacing
this in its former position. The final reproduction
must be from under the centre card, the performer
again ringing the changes before returning
the coin to the owner. At the close of the trick all
three cards are placed on the pack, the centre overlay
going with them. The other two overlays are
left on the mat, each still covering its own coin,
and the whole being carried off together. If the
mat is of the folding kind it can be closed before
removal, effectually concealing the accessories
used in the trick.</p>

<p>Some amount of skill will be found necessary
to pick up the card with or without the corresponding
overlay, as may be desired. The difficulty
however speedily disappears with practice. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
the other hand, the trick is well worth the trouble
needed to master it, for if the spectators are convinced
(as, given perfect execution, they should
be) that it is really the borrowed coin which travels
about as it appears to do, nothing short of genuine
magic will furnish an adequate explanation.</p>

<p>The performer is of course by no means bound
to adopt the <i>mise en scène</i> above suggested. If
preferred, the patter might be based on a supposed
plot between the two knaves to rob the queen, the
coin representing the stolen property, secretly
passed from the one to the other when either was
accused of the theft. The story might conclude
with an appeal by the queen to a benevolent
magician, through whose good offices her property
is brought back to its original position, and in due
course restored to her. The touch of the mystic
wand would naturally play an important part in
effecting the restoration.</p>

<h2 id="CARD_TRICKS">CARD TRICKS</h2>

<h3>ARITHMETIC BY MAGIC</h3>

<p><i>Preparation.</i> The two “flower-pots” (<a href="#Page_5">see page
5</a>), separated, are placed upon the table. Also the
card mat (<a href="#Page_1">see page 1</a>), loaded with the <i>ten</i> of any
given suit, say diamonds, taken from the pack performer
is about to use, and a double-faced card,
representing on the one side the seven, and on the
other the three of the same suit. The deuce and
five of same suit to be laid on the top of the pack.</p>

<p>Performer, advancing pack in hand, palms off
the two top cards, and offers the rest to be shuffled.
This done, he forces these two cards on different
persons. On receiving back one of them, he brings
it to the top; executes a false shuffle leaving it in
the same position; brings it again to the middle by
the pass, and has the second card replaced upon it;
then, once again making the pass, brings both
together to the top.</p>

<p>(The use of the Charlier pass is here recommended.)</p>

<p>The patter may be to something like the following
effect: “Two cards have been chosen, ladies
and gentlemen. I can’t say what they are, but I
can very easily find out. I shall simply order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
them to rise up and paw the air. It all depends on
the strength of the will. I myself happen to have
a very strong will, in fact, I don’t know anyone
who has a stronger will, except my wife. I exert
my will, and say, ‘first card, rise!’ and up it comes,
as you see.”</p>

<p>Stepping well back from the spectators, so that
they cannot distinguish from what part of the pack
the card comes, he works up the hindmost card
by the familiar “hand” method. (“Modern
Magic,” p. 129.)</p>

<p>“Here we have one of the two cards. Let us see
what it is. The five of diamonds! Good! And
now for the other. Second card; rise! Up comes
another card, you see, the deuce of diamonds.
Those are the cards which were drawn, are they
not?</p>

<p>“Now the question arises, ‘what shall we do with
them?’ It is a pity the ladies didn’t choose bigger
cards. You can’t ‘go nap’<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> on a deuce and a five,
can you? I think I can’t do better than use them
to show you a little experiment in conjurer’s arithmetic.
Will some young mathematician among
the audience kindly tell us what two and five, added
together, make?” (He waits for reply, but if
none, pretends to hear one.) “Seven! Right
first time. And if you take two from five how
many remain? Three? Good again. Really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
there are lot of clever people about, if you know
where to look for them.</p>

<p>“Now I want to show you that the cards know
all about it themselves; in fact, they are just as
clever at doing sums as we are. I will take these
two cards and drop them into one of these pretty
flower-pots. Let me show you first that it is quite
empty.”</p>

<p>He lays the cards on the little mat while showing
inside of flower-pot (the one with secret
pocket), then picks up mat, and transfers it from
hand to hand, showing, without remark, that the
hands are otherwise empty, and lets the two cards
slide off it into the flower-pot, the concealed cards
naturally going with them.</p>

<p>“Now, ladies and gentlemen, what shall the cards
do for you, the addition, or the subtraction sum?
It is all the same to me. The addition? Very
good. They can’t talk, so they will call another
card from the pack to give you the answer. Yes,
here we have it. Five&mdash;and two&mdash;are&mdash;seven.”</p>

<p>As he names each card, he produces it from the
flower-pot, the third being the double-faced card,
shown as the seven.</p>

<p>“Now I can hear what some of you are thinking.
Oh, yes! I often hear what people think. You
are thinking that if you had said subtraction
instead of addition, I should have been in what is
popularly called a hole. But you are mistaken.
Now we will ask the cards to do the subtraction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
sum. The seven will go back to the pack, and send
another card in its place.” He drops all three
cards back into the flower-pot, and brings them up
as before, save that this time the trick card is made
to face the other way. “<i>Five</i>&mdash;less <i>two</i>&mdash;are
<i>three! Quod erat demonstrandum</i>, as our old
friend Euclid used to say when he had just floored
a new poser. As the cards seem to be in a good
humour, we will try them once more, and see if we
can get them to do a little multiplication.” (He
drops the three cards into the flower-pot, as before,
but this time lets the fake card fall into
the pocket.) “Five times&mdash;two&mdash;are ‘ten.’”
(Showing the two cards and the ten, in that order.)</p>

<p>“Now I will ask some gentleman to see that these
three cards really belong to the pack. The three
and seven went back to it as soon as they were done
with. The flower-pot, as you see, is again empty.”
(He shows by lifting it that apparently it is so.)</p>

<p>If the first choice of the audience is for subtraction
the order of production will naturally be
varied accordingly.</p>

<h3>THOSE NAUGHTY KNAVES</h3>

<p>This item may be described, if preferred, as
“Knavish Tricks.”</p>

<p><i>Requirements.</i> Card mat loaded with knaves of
spades, hearts and diamonds, taken from the pack
in use. Knave of clubs on top of pack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Presentation.</i> Advance, palming off the knave
of clubs, and offer pack to be shuffled. When it is
returned, force the knave on one of the company.
Borrow a hat, and after showing that it is empty,
place it, crown downwards, on the table. Receive
back the drawn card upon the mat, remarking that
you will place it in the hat, which you do accordingly,
the other three knaves going in with it.
Then, assuming a worried expression, deliver patter
to something like the following effect.</p>

<p>“I am afraid, ladies and gentlemen, that I shall
not be able to show you the experiment I had
intended. I have a telepathic nerve in my left
thumb, a sort of private fire alarm, only more so,
which always gives me warning when things are
going wrong, and I feel it now. If you have read
‘Macbeth,’ you will remember that one of the
witches says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘By the pricking of my thumbs,</div>
<div class="verse">Something wicked this way comes.’</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“I have often wondered whether that old lady
could have been a sort of great-great-great grandmother
of mine. Magic certainly runs in the
family, and we may have inherited it from her.
Anyhow, I have just the same sort of sensation
myself. Unfortunately, in my case the warning is
incomplete. I dare say you will remember that
story (I rather think it’s in Macaulay’s ‘Lays of
Ancient Rome’), about Little Queen Cole. Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
Majesty had the misfortune to develop a mole upon
her nose, and King Cole was worried about it. He
consulted Old Moore and Zadkiel, and all the leading
astrologers of the day, but all they could tell
him was</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘A mole upon the face</div>
<div class="verse">Shows that something will take place,</div>
<div class="verse">But not what that something will be.’</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>That’s just my case. My prophetic thumb merely
tells me that something is wrong, but doesn’t say
what. It may be drains, or the house on fire, or
something in the county court. You never can
tell!</p>

<p>“Of course it’s nothing of that sort now. In
the present case it has no doubt something to do
with the experiment I want to show you. You
chose your card quite freely, did you not, Madam?
It never matters to me in the least what card is
chosen, with the exception of one particular card,
which is a holy terror. May I ask if you happened
to draw the knave of clubs? Yes? I feared as
much. The knave of clubs is the bane of my life.
He is always endeavouring to get himself chosen,
and then he does his best to upset my arrangements.
And the worst of it is, he leads away the
other three knaves. The four of them form a
secret society, which they call ‘The cheerful blackguards.’
The knave of clubs is the president, and
the rest have to do just as he tells them. He communicates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
with them by means of a sort of wireless
telegraphy, and when he calls they go to him
at once.” (You here make the “click.”) “Did
you hear that sound? That’s his call now,
despatched by wireless from the hat to the very
middle of the pack. I have no doubt that we shall
find that the other three knaves have already left it,
and joined him in the hat.” (Make believe to look
over the pack, and hand it to a spectator.) “Yes!
just as I thought: they are all gone.” (To a spectator.)
“See for yourself, sir. Not a single
knave left. And here they all are, in the hat.”
(Whence they are produced accordingly.)</p>

<p>As the “click” in some cases adds much to the
effect of a trick, and as it may to some readers be
an unfamiliar sleight, I may pause to explain that
it is executed as follows: Take the pack in either
hand, held upright between forefinger and thumb,
a little more than halfway down, with the middle
finger curled up behind it as in Fig. 13. With the
tip of the third finger bend back the extreme bottom
corners of the last half dozen or so of the
cards, allowing them to escape again smartly.
The sound made by the corners in springing back
again constitutes the “click.” It needs a little
practice, but if the cards are held properly, and
the sleight worked smartly, the sound will be
audible at a considerable distance, whilst the movement
of the finger producing it is quite invisible
to the spectators.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 235px;">
<img src="images/figure13.jpg" width="235" height="300" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 13</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>But we have not yet done with our trick. You
may resume as follows:</p>

<p>“I will give you a further illustration of what I
have to put up with from the knaves. I should
like you to be satisfied that I have nothing to do
with their bad behaviour.” (You palm off the
three top cards, and with the same hand offer the
four knaves to a spectator.) “Will you, sir, make
sure that these really are the four knaves, and then
place them here on the top of the pack,”&mdash;offered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
with the left hand. When the knaves have been
laid upon it, you transfer it to the opposite hand,
and palm on to them the three concealed cards,
but immediately slide them off again, with the
uppermost of the four knaves beneath them. You
hold them up in a careless way, so that the
audience, catching sight of this card, may be confirmed
in the belief that the cards exhibited in the
right hand are really the four knaves.</p>

<p>“Here we have the four knaves, at present all
together. I will now distribute them in different
parts of the pack, as far apart as possible. One
here, nearly at the bottom, one a little higher up,
another about the middle, and this last” (you show
it carelessly), “close to the top.” (This, being a
genuine knave, must be placed among the other
knaves.) “They could hardly be placed farther
apart than that: but to make things a little more
difficult for them, I will ask some lady to cut the
cards.”</p>

<p>This done, and the cards handed back to you,
you repeat the click. “There it is again: the wireless
signal. You can all bear witness that I have
nothing to do with the matter. Now, Sir, will you
kindly examine the pack, and unless I am much
mistaken, you will find that the other three knaves
have answered Black Jack’s call, and that the four
cheerful blackguards have got together again, in
which case, with your permission, I will leave them
severely alone, and try some other experiment.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>The expert will recognise this last effect as a
“chestnut” among card tricks, but it is none the
worse on that account, and it forms a particularly
appropriate sequel to the principal trick.</p>

<p>If the performer possesses the “flower-pot,” one
of these will naturally be used in place of the hat.</p>

<h3>MAGNETIC MAGIC</h3>

<p><i>Requirements.</i> Card mat, loaded with a single
known card (precise nature optional). Pack of
cards with corresponding card at top. A horseshoe
magnet, the larger the better for the sake of
effect. The two flower-pots, placed at some distance
apart, preferably on separate tables.</p>

<p>We will suppose that the card selected for the
purpose of the trick is the ten of spades. Performer
advances, and delivers patter to something
like the following effect.</p>

<p>“By way of a change, I should like now to show
you a little experiment in magnetism, but magnetism
of a new kind. The old sort was a comparatively
poor affair. It was only useful with
iron or steel. Anything else it wouldn’t attract
for nuts. My sort of magnetism is a very superior
article. It will attract all sorts of things, so long
as they are not too heavy, like a sack of coals, or a
lawyer’s bill. So far, I have been chiefly experimenting
with cards, and I will show you how it
works.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>“I want three ladies each to choose a card from
this pack.” (He forces the ten of spades, allowing
the other two cards to be chosen freely, and
takes all three back, face down, on the mat, keeping
in mind which of them is the forced card.) “I
will take one of these cards.” (He picks up the
forced card, and holds it aloft.) “Please all
notice what it is: I don’t want to see it myself. I
drop it into this pretty flower-pot” (actually dropping
it into the secret pocket). “And now as to
these other two.” (He picks them up and shows
them, then replacing them on the mat.) “These
I will place in the other flower-pot. First, however,
I will show you that at present it is empty.”
He does so, and then lets the two cards slide off
the mat into the pot, the concealed card going with
them.</p>

<p>“Now I take this magnet. It is a very powerful
magnet, and I make it still more vigorous by
rubbing it on my left coat sleeve. Do you know
why on the left? You all give it up? Because in
this case the left happens to be right. Simple,
when you know it, isn’t it? Again, you will
observe that one-half of this magnet is painted
red. Can you guess why that is? It’s so that
when it is wanted it is sure to be ‘reddy.’ I hear
a lady smile! Thank you <i>so</i> much! This is the
eleven hundred and third time I have let off that
little impromptu joke, and no one has ever laughed
at it till now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, as I was saying, or as I was going to say
when the lady interrupted me&mdash;I mean complimented
me, by smiling&mdash;Upon my word, I’ve forgotten
for the moment what I <i>was</i> going to say, but
I daresay it was of no consequence, so we’ll skip
it, and proceed at once to ‘business as usual.’</p>

<p>“Observe, I just draw the magnet slowly across
from the one flower-pot to the other, when the
single card, being naturally the weaker, will be
drawn out of its own flower-pot, and join the other
two.” (Looks into flower-pot holding the pair.)</p>

<p>“Yes, it has found its way, as you see.” (Lifts
the pot, and shows that the third card is on the table
with the other two.) “And as it’s a well-known
fact that nobody but a bird can be in two places at
the same time, it naturally follows that it is no
longer in this other pot, which is once more
empty.” (Lifts it up and shows that it is so.)</p>

<p><i>Variation.</i> If the flower-pots are not available,
the single card may be placed in a card box, or
other suitable appliance adapted for causing its
disappearance, the other two, with the concealed
card, being dropped from the mat into a borrowed
hat.</p>

<h3>THE TELEPATHIC TAPE</h3>

<p><i>Requirements.</i> Two or three yards of half-inch
tape or ribbon, wound on a reel, to which its inner
end is secured, and having a loop on its outer end.
Coin mat made adhesive, and two packs of cards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
which we will call A and B respectively. From
pack A take a court card (say the queen of diamonds),
and press it face down against the waxed
side of the mat: then turn this over, and place the
rest of the pack upon its unprepared side. On the
top of pack B lay the corresponding card, in readiness
for forcing. This pack also to be placed on
table.</p>

<p><i>Presentation.</i> Advance with pack A on the mat.
Invite a gentleman to take it in his own hands
and after shuffling, to pick out a card, and without
looking at it, lay it face down on the mat. Remark:
“I have asked you not to look at the card,
because I find people fancy I find out by what is
called thought-reading, and if you don’t know the
card yourself, I can’t find it out that way, can I?
You are sure you don’t know what card you have
taken? I can honestly say that I don’t. Now
please notice that I don’t look at it, or even touch
it&mdash;I will place it here, where you can all keep an
eye on it. You had better keep the other eye on
me.”</p>

<p>You accordingly place the mat on the table, in
transit keeping the card just laid upon it in place
by the pressure of the thumb, and just as you
reach the table, under cover of your own body, turn
over the mat, so as to bring the adhering card
uppermost.</p>

<p>You then say, picking up the reel, “I must now
introduce to your notice my telepathic tape. Like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
myself, it isn’t anything particular to look at, but
it has an extraordinary talent for finding out
things; even secrets that people don’t know themselves.
Now you will admit that the name of that
card on the table is at present an A1, copperbottomed
secret. Even the gentleman who chose the
card doesn’t know what it is; you don’t know;
in fact nobody knows. Nothing could well be more
secret than that. But this tape will find it out.
Will you, Sir,”&mdash;(addressing the gentleman who
chose the card) “be kind enough to pass this loop
over your left little finger. Thank you, and now
I want some lady to assist me. Perhaps you will
oblige, Madam?” A sufficient length of the tape
is unrolled, and the reel placed in the lady’s hands.
“And now I will ask you to do me the further
favor of taking a card from this other pack.”
(The second queen is forced on the lady.)</p>

<p>“Now, Madam, what was the card the gentleman
chose? You don’t know? Oh, yes, you do. The
tape has told you. Unless it has betrayed me for
the first time in my experience, it will have compelled
you by an effect of sympathy to draw the
very same kind of card as the one freely chosen, as
you will remember from the other pack. What
card did you draw? The queen of diamonds?”
(Goes to table, and turns up card on tray.) “The
tape was right, you see. The card the gentleman
drew is also a queen of diamonds.”</p>

<p>In default of the card mat, the trick can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
equally well performed by the aid of the card-box,
or any other appliance for “changing” a card.</p>

<h3>A CARD COMEDY</h3>

<p>This may be otherwise described for programme
purposes as “A Royal Row,” or “A Row in a
Royal Family.”</p>

<p><i>Preparation.</i> Card mat loaded with two kings
of hearts: one of them taken from the pack
to be used: the other a spare card. The king of
clubs and queen of hearts to be laid on top of pack.
The two flower-pots on table.</p>

<p><i>Presentation.</i> Advancing to the company, palm
off the two top cards, and hand the pack to be
shuffled. This done, force the palmed cards on
two different persons. Then say, “I want you to
take notice that I do not handle or tamper in any
way with either of the cards you have chosen.
Please lay them yourselves face down on this mat.
Thank you. Now still without touching them I
will put them temporarily in this elegant flower-pot,
which you observe is quite empty. You see
that it has neither top nor bottom, and nothing
between. You couldn’t have anything much
emptier than that, could you?”</p>

<p>Having duly exhibited the flower-pot (this by
the way must be the one <i>without</i> pocket) you let
the two drawn cards slide off the mat into it, the
two concealed kings going with them. Then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
assuming a perplexed air, you say, “I don’t know
why it is, but I have that peculiar sensation in
my left thumb that always means that something
has gone wrong. What it is in this case I can’t
imagine, but I must find out before we go further.
As the two chosen cards have passed out of my
hands, I may now ask the ladies who drew them
to name them.</p>

<p>“The queen of hearts and the king of clubs, you
say? Ah! that accounts for it. When those two
cards come together there is sure to be trouble.
The queen of hearts is a bit of a flirt, and the king
of hearts is very jealous, particularly of the king
of clubs, who is rather a gay dog, though he is old
enough to know better. I fancy I hear some sort
of commotion going on in the flower-pot.” (You
look into it.) “Yes, it is just as I feared. The
king of hearts has found out that his queen has gone
off with the king of clubs, and has followed the
queen post-haste. Here he is, you see.” (You
plunge hand into flower-pot, and take out and
exhibit the two drawn cards, and with them one of
the two kings of hearts.) “It’s too bad, for as a
matter of fact the queen of hearts doesn’t really
care two-pence about the king of clubs. In fact
she has even been known to call him a giddy old
kipper.</p>

<p>“But I can’t have my arrangements upset by
these little family jars. To teach the king of
hearts better manners I shall put him in solitary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
confinement. We will drop him into the other
flower-pot, which, as you see, is also empty.”
(The card is in this case not dropped through the
pot, but into the pocket.)</p>

<p>“Now we shall be able to get on. No! my left
thumb tells me that there is still something not
quite right.” (Glance into second flower-pot.)
“Upon my word, this is too bad. The king of
hearts has already got away and followed the
queen again.” (Lift flower-pot, and show that the
king has disappeared.) “I thought I had him
safe, but his prison, as you see, is empty, and here
he is again in the first flower-pot.” (Show the
three cards accordingly.) “He is too many for
me; I can’t show you what I had intended. I must
give it up and try something else.”</p>

<p><i>Variation.</i> Load mat with a single king of
hearts and the queen of clubs, the latter taken from
the pack. Proceed as before up to the putting of
the king in prison, and then exhibit the queen of
clubs, as having come in pursuit of her spouse, the
patter being modified accordingly. The imprisoned
king of hearts will still be found to have
escaped, but in this case to have returned to the
pack.</p>

<p>For lack of the two flower-pots, the drawn cards
may be dropped with the concealed pair into a borrowed
hat, and the jealous king made to escape
from a card-box, or some similar appliance.</p>

<p><i>Apropos</i> of the card-box, by the way, I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
always had a sort of affection for this in its oldest
and simplest form, viz., the reversible flat box with
loose flap falling from the one into the other half
at pleasure. I should not recommend the use of
it at a school treat, as there would be much risk
of some demon small boy proclaiming to all whom
it might concern that he “knows how that’s done,”
but before an average mixed audience its use is
safe enough. Should one of the spectators happen
to be acquainted with the box he will probably
smile in a superior way, pluming himself on having
a little inside information, though he may be no
nearer the complete solution of the trick than the
rest of the company.</p>

<p>The expert will easily guard himself against
even this small risk. For example, he may use a
duplicate box, innocent of guile, ostensibly merely
to contain the cards he is about to use, and after
turning the pack out of it upon the table, switch
this (obviously empty) box for the faked box to be
used later, or after using the latter he may extract
the fake and the superseded card during the journey
back to his table, where the box will of course
be inspection-proof.</p>

<p>Better still, he may make matters absolutely safe
by using an improved box, which has been christened
the “Fast and Loose” card-box. This is a
recent invention of an Italian wizard named
Veroni, of Glasgow (an old soldier of Garibaldi).
It is an idealised version of the old flat box, being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
of the same shape, but a trifle larger. The loose
slab is retained, but it is only loose when the performer
desires it to be so. The box may be
handled beforehand with the utmost freedom, and
after a card has been placed in it it may be closed
and re-opened any number of times, nothing happening
till, “Presto,” a mere touch in the right
place, and the flap is free. When the box is now
closed, this falls into the opposite portion, concealing
the card, or producing another; and again
locking itself, automatically, in its new position.
The box in this condition will again stand the
closest scrutiny.</p>

<p>Whether this box is yet placed upon the market
I cannot say (having myself been favoured with a
sight of an “advance” model), but it will certainly
commend itself to all who appreciate a good thing
in the way of ingenuity of contrivance and
mechanical finish.</p>

<h3>A ROYAL TUG OF WAR</h3>

<p><i>Preparation.</i> Card mat to be loaded with king
of hearts and king of diamonds, <i>not</i> taken from
the pack in use. Flower-pots on table.</p>

<p>Performer advances with ordinary pack, delivering
patter to something like the following effect.
“It is not generally known, ladies and gentlemen,
what a lot of human nature there is about a pack
of cards. They have their likes and dislikes, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
their little tempers, just as we have. Some of
them are bosom friends; others again hate each
other like rival suitors to the same best girl. The
four kings are generally pretty friendly, but there
is a good deal of emulation between them, particularly
between the two red kings on the one
hand, and the two black ones on the other. Each
pair claims to be the stronger, and they are always
pleased to have a chance of putting the matter to
the test.</p>

<p>“I will give you an illustration of this, by allowing
them to hold a little tug of war. They have
already had six trials, and each side has won three
of them. This evening we will let them play a
final game, which is to settle the matter. Will you,
sir, kindly pick out the four kings for me, and lay
them on this little tray. Thank you!” (This
done, performer lays mat with cards on table.)</p>

<p>“I will drop the two red kings into this flower-pot.”
He takes them from the mat and after
showing them drops them into the flower-pot (in
reality into the pocket), “and the black ones into
this other.” (The black kings are allowed to slide
directly off the mat, into the flower-pot, the concealed
pair going with them.) “Are your Majesties
ready? Silence gives consent! Then Go!”</p>

<p>He waits a moment or two, and then looks over
into the flower-pot with the pocket. “Nothing has
happened yet. Yes, there goes the king of diamonds,
pulled over to the other side. There’s not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
much chance now for the poor king of hearts, left
single-handed. He won’t hold out long. Yes!
Now he is gone too.”</p>

<p>Performer lifts flower-pot, with fingers inside
pressing against pocket, and shows it apparently
empty. “And here, in the other flower-pot” (lifts
it and shows the four cards lying together on
table) “are all four Kings. One more score to
black. You didn’t see the cards go? Of course
you didn’t; because they fly horizontally, like the
aeroplanes, and they go so fast that they get there
almost before they have started.”</p>

<h3>SYMPATHETIC CARDS</h3>

<p><i>Preparation.</i> Card mat loaded with two cards
of different denomination, say the queen of clubs
and the knave of diamonds, <i>taken from the pack</i>.
Flower-pots on table.</p>

<p><i>Presentation.</i> Force the corresponding cards
of same colour (in this case the queen of spades
and the knave of hearts), lay the pack aside, and
take the drawn cards back face down on the mat,
leaving them thus on table till needed. The patter
may run as follows:</p>

<p>“As I think I have mentioned before, the cards
of a pack, from long association, become a sort of
family. They have their likes and dislikes, just
as human beings have. In particular, there is a
curious bond of sympathy between each pair of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
the same colour, say the king of hearts and the king
of diamonds, or the ten of clubs and ten of spades.
If they are parted, and they possibly can, they will
get together again.</p>

<p>“I will try to give you an example with the cards
that have been drawn. We will put them for the
moment in this pretty flower-pot, which, as you see,
is quite empty.” (Show by lifting it up, that it is
so, and then drop the two cards from the mat into
it, the concealed pair going with them.) “They
will only require to be assisted by a gentle electric
current, which I shall create by waving my wand,
so.</p>

<p>“Before we go any further, will the ladies who
drew the cards say what they were,&mdash;I don’t mind
asking you now, because they have passed out of
my control. The queen of spades and the knave
of hearts, you say? A fortunate choice, for the
queen of spades and the knave of hearts happen to
be particular friends, so I think we may now be
sure of success. Now to establish the wireless
wave, and I doubt not the queen of clubs and the
knave of diamonds will speedily find them.
(Make any appropriate gesture with wand.)</p>

<p>“Did you notice a little flash, like the striking
of a very inferior lucifer match in a gale of wind?
That’s when they went. Quick work, isn’t it?
The cards were timed by two gentlemen one evening,
each with his own watch. By the one gentleman’s
watch they started at one minute past nine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
and by the other gentleman’s watch, they arrived
at one minute <i>to</i> nine, so it is clear that they must
have made the journey in two minutes less than no
time. But let us make sure that they have
arrived.” Lift the flower-pot, and show the four
cards lying on the table together. “And now, to
convince you that there is no deception, will some
lady or gentleman kindly look through the pack,
and make sure that the queen of clubs and knave
of diamonds have really left it.” Which is found
to be the case.</p>

<p>The trick may of course be worked with any two
pairs of cards, the mat being loaded and the corresponding
cards forced accordingly.</p>

<h3>TELL-TALE FINGERS</h3>

<p>The discovery, in some more or less mysterious
way, of an unknown card is one of the stock feats
of the conjurer, and indeed in one shape or another
is one of the most hackneyed of card tricks. But
the wise magician never discards a good trick simply
because it is an old one. He repolishes it, adds
a bit here, takes away a bit there, presents it in a
new shape and with new patter, and behold! the
“chestnut” of yesterday becomes a latest novelty
of today.</p>

<p>To obtain the maximum effect from a trick of the
above kind, it is necessary in the first place to convince
the spectator that the drawn card cannot possibly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
be known beforehand to the performer; and
in the second place to persuade him that it is discovered
in some actually impossible (and therefore
magical) way; taking advantage, where possible,
of some known scientific truth which may lend
colour to your suggestion. It is surprising, in conjuring
matters, how much even the smallest percentage
of fact increases the power of the average
spectator for swallowing fiction. The patter for
the trick which follows has been arranged upon
these lines.</p>

<p>The requisites for the trick are a pack of cards
from which three known cards have been withdrawn
and palmed (or so placed to be in instant
readiness for palming), a hand-mirror, and a silk
handkerchief.</p>

<p>The introductory oration may run somewhat as
follows:</p>

<p>“You all know, ladies and gentlemen, what an
important part finger-prints now play in the detection
of crime. Happily there is no connection
between conjuring and crime, beyond the fact that
they both begin with a <i>C</i>. No conjurer that I
know of has ever murdered anybody or been murdered
himself, and when a conjurer borrows a half-crown,
he always&mdash;well, almost always returns it.
But each one of us, whether criminal or curate,
burglar or bishop, possesses a definite set of finger-prints,
quite unlike those of anybody else. And,
what is more, we cannot touch anything, ever so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
lightly, without leaving upon it our sign manual
in the shape of a more or less perfect impression
of our fingers, imperceptible to ourselves, but quite
visible to the expert in such matters.</p>

<p>“Practice in distinguishing such points forms
a highly interesting study. Of course it must be
pursued with a proper amount of tact, or it may
get you into trouble, as in the case of a gentleman
I once heard of who took up the study with more
zeal than discretion. He said to his wife, not leading
up to the subject gently, as he should have done,
but in a peremptory sort of way, ‘Maria, I want
your finger-prints.’ Unfortunately, Maria was
rather a quick-tempered lady, and she had just
been having a few words, of a hostile nature, with
the cook. She slapped his face, and said, ‘Well,
now you’ve got ’em.’ He had! They were very
distinct, but not quite in the shape he wanted. I
am going to ask permission to read some of your
finger-prints, but, I trust without fear of such
painful results.</p>

<p>“In the first place, I should like this pack of
cards to be thoroughly well shuffled.”</p>

<p>While this is done, performer palms the three
known cards, and when the pack is returned, proceeds
to force them on different members of the
company. Each of the drawers is requested to
allow his or her card to lie for a few moments face
down on the palm of the outspread hand. The
cards drawn are then returned to the pack, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
is again shuffled, and spread face upward on the
table.</p>

<p>“Each of the three cards which have been drawn
now has a complete set of finger-prints upon its
surface, but there are no doubt others on many
other cards, the result of previous handling. To
enable me to distinguish the right ones, I must ask
each person who chose a card to give me, for the
purpose of comparison, a fresh impression, on
the glass of this mirror. First, however, we
must remove any prints that may already be upon
it.”</p>

<p>He accordingly breathes upon the glass, and
wipes it carefully with the handkerchief.</p>

<p>“Now, Sir” (to the person who first drew), “will
you kindly press your hand flat against the glass.
Thank you. Not a very clear impression, but I
dare say it will be good enough. I have now only
to discover the card bearing the same imprint, and
I shall know that it was the one you drew.” (He
picks it out from the exposed cards on the table.)
“Here it is, I think, the &mdash;&mdash; of &mdash;&mdash;” (as the case
may be).</p>

<p>The other two cards are then discovered after
the same fashion. As the performer knows
beforehand what they are, this will give him little
trouble, but he will be wise, for the sake of effect,
not to discover them too readily. For the same
reason, great importance should ostensibly be
attached to the thorough cleaning of the hand mirror<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
before each new attempt, so as to get a clear
impression.</p>

<p>The trick as above described can be worked with
any pack of cards, but where those used are the
performer’s own property, he can make it even
more effective by marking the three cards to be
freed in such a way as to be distinguishable (by
himself only) by their backs. The drawers in this
case are requested to press their hand against the
<i>back</i> of the card, and the cards are spread face
down upon the table, the performer apparently not
knowing the nature of the card indicated to him
until he has turned it up.</p>

<h3>DIVINATION DOUBLY DIFFICULT</h3>

<p>This trick, though it merely rests upon a combination
of methods already familiar to the expert,
may as a whole fairly claim to be a complete novelty.
The <i>mise en scène</i> is so simple, and the
room for deception apparently so small, that to the
uninitiated it seems like a genuine miracle.
Unlike most card tricks, it is even better adapted
to the stage than to the drawing-room.</p>

<p>The effect of the trick, baldly stated, is that the
performer divines the nature of nine cards,
selected apparently quite haphazard, and then
picks out the corresponding cards from another
pack, freely shuffled and covered by a handkerchief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>The requirements for the trick consist of two
packs of cards, and an envelope with adhesive flap,
of such a size as to accommodate one of them. One
of the two packs is a “forcing” pack, consisting of
three cards only, each seventeen times repeated.
The cards of each kind are however not grouped
all together, as is usually the case, but are arranged
after the manner explained in <i>More Magic</i> (p. 13),
viz.: assuming the three cards to be the knave of
clubs, the seven of spades, and the nine of diamonds,
the pack will consist of groups of those
three cards, in the same order, repeated throughout.
The effect of this arrangement is that,
wherever the pack be cut, the three cards above
or below the cut will always be a set of those three
cards: and the same result follows, however many
times the pack may be cut, or however many such
groups may have been taken from it.</p>

<p>The second pack has no preparation, but the
three cards corresponding to those of which the
forcing pack is composed are so placed as to be
ready to hand for palming.</p>

<p>The performer advances with the forcing pack,
meanwhile executing a false shuffle of the kind
which leaves the pack as if cut, but otherwise
undisturbed as to order. Holding the pack on the
outstretched palm of his left hand, he invites someone
to cut it. This done, he takes back with the
other hand the upper portion of the cut, and says,
“You have cut where you pleased, have you not?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
If you think I made cut at that particular point,
you can cut again. You are satisfied? Then I
will ask you to be good enough to take three cards
from the top of this lower heap. Keep them carefully.
Don’t let me see them: in fact don’t show
them just yet to anyone, but please remember
exactly what they are.” He replaces the top half
of the cut, and passing to another spectator, at
some little distance from the first, has the pack cut
again, and a second three cards taken in like manner.
This is repeated with a third person, just far
enough away from the second as to preclude any
possibility of the three drawers comparing their
cards.</p>

<p>“Now, ladies and gentlemen, you must all agree
that I have not sought to influence the choice of
these gentlemen” (or ladies, as the case may be)
“in the slightest degree, and it must be equally
clear to you that I cannot possibly know even one
of the cards that have been chosen. To make sure
that I do not get sight of them in any way, we will
have them placed, with the remainder of the pack,
in this envelope.” He collects the cards accordingly,
allowing each person who drew to replace
his cards himself in the envelope, and requesting
the last person to moisten the flap, and make all
secure.</p>

<p>Returning to his table, he places the closed
envelope in full view. “I shall now want the
assistance of some gentleman. Thank you, sir.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
Will you kindly shuffle this other pack for me.”
(He runs the cards over fanwise, showing their
faces, so as to prove that they are an ordinary
mixed pack: then hands them to be shuffled, and
while this is being done, palms the three secreted
cards.) “Shuffle them thoroughly, please, and then
spread them a little, faces down, upon the table,
and lay your handkerchief over them.</p>

<p>“Now I am going, in the first place, to attempt
a little thought-reading. I shall endeavour by
that means to discover the three cards each person
chose, and then, by means of the sense of touch,
which I have cultivated to a rather unusual degree,
to pick them out, without seeing them, from among
the cards under the handkerchief. I shall only
ask one indulgence. To leave a little margin for
possible mistakes. I shall ask your permission to
pick out four cards instead of three for each person,
so as to give me one extra chance. Will the
gentleman who drew first kindly look my way, and
say to himself slowly, the names of the cards he
drew. Thank you, Sir! I think I read them
right.” He inserts his hand under the handkerchief,
and after a little pretended fumbling, brings
out the three palmed cards, with one indifferent
card in front of them. He does not show or look
at them, but asks the second chooser to think hard
of his three cards, afterwards taking four more
from under the handkerchief. Having done the
same in the case of the third drawer, he spreads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
the twelve cards he has taken from under the handkerchief,
and shows them fanwise. Addressing
the first drawer, he says, “Your three cards are
among these, I think, sir?” and the same question
is then addressed to the other two choosers, the
answer being of course in the affirmative.</p>

<p>“Now, gentlemen, in order to prove that there
is no deception, I will take away three cards at a
time, one from each set of three. Pray observe
that from beginning to end, I have not looked at
the face of any card.” He accordingly removes
one of the forced, and two of the indifferent cards,
making however some pretence of selection and
throws them aside. “There are now only two
cards belonging to each gentleman left. That is
so, is it not?”</p>

<p>The question is addressed to each of the three
drawers in turn, and answered accordingly, after
which the same process is again twice repeated.</p>

<p>“And now, gentlemen, we have three cards left,
belonging to neither of you, which is just as it
should be. It is a peculiarity of this experiment
that if it comes out right it always brings good
luck to those taking part in it, so you may all fairly
expect to live happily ever afterwards, and I trust
you will.”</p>

<p>If the performance is given before the family
circle, or very intimate friends (who sometimes
consider themselves privileged to be disagreeable),
it is just possible that some ill-mannered person,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
in the hope of embarrassing the conjurer, may ask
at the close to be allowed to examine the envelope
containing the drawn cards. Such an examination,
if permitted, would of course largely give
away the trick. If the performer has any reason
to fear such a contingency, he may guard against
it by “switching” the envelope, during his return
to the table with it, for a duplicate containing an
ordinary mixed pack. In some part of this the
three cards corresponding to those drawn should
be placed <i>together</i>, as the obnoxious person, if himself
one of the drawers, will naturally expect so to
find them.</p>

<p>At a public performance such a precaution
would be supererogatory.</p>

<h3>A NEW LONG CARD PACK AND A TRICK
DEPENDENT ON ITS USE</h3>

<p>Some few months ago I was shown by a clever
amateur, Mr. Victor Farrelly, a pack of cards prepared,
after a method of his own, to replace in a
more subtle form, the familiar <i>biseauté</i> pack. Mr.
Farrelly’s plan is to round off, in a very minute
degree, three of the corners of an ordinary pack.
If a given card be turned round in a pack so
treated, it is obvious that its unfiled corner will
project, to a microscopic extent, beyond those
above and below it, rendering the card instantly
discoverable by touch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Farrelly’s idea is decidedly ingenious, but
the uses of the <i>biseauté</i> pack are rather limited,
and the fact that the pack must be reversed before
the card is replaced in it is a drawback. It struck
me, on reflection, that the idea might be developed,
in a slightly different direction, to greater advantage.</p>

<p>My own plan is as follows: Two packs, exactly
alike are used. As to one of these, I treat all four
corners after the manner indicated by Mr. Farrelly,
when any card of the second pack, inserted
into the one so treated, naturally becomes in effect,
a long card. There is in this case no need to
reverse the pack, and as the minute projection is
duplicated at each end of the diagonal, a less degree
of rounding off is necessary.</p>

<p>As a practical illustration of the possible uses
of such a pack, I offer the trick which I am about to
describe. The expert will recognise that, save for
the use of the new pack, it is merely a combination
of well-known methods, but as regards the mode
of presentation it is original, and I think will be
found worthy of a place in the <i>répertoire</i> of the
card-conjurer.</p>

<p>For the purpose of description we will call the
pack with rounded corners the “short,” and the
other the “long” pack. Three known cards are
borrowed from the long pack, which may then be
put aside, as it plays no further part in the trick.
These three cards are palmed, and after the short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
pack has been shuffled by one of the company, are
added to it, and forced upon three different spectators.
We will suppose that the three selected
cards are the queen of hearts, forced on a gentleman;
the king of clubs and the ten of diamonds;
the two last mentioned forced on ladies.</p>

<p>This done, each of the drawers is invited to
replace his or her card in the pack, which is passed
from the one to the other for that purpose, and
before it is returned to you is once more shuffled.
You then deliver a “yarn” to something like the
following effect:</p>

<p>“Please bear in mind, ladies and gentlemen,
exactly what has been done. To begin with, you
have seen that the pack was thoroughly well
shuffled. Three cards were then freely chosen
from it. They have been put back, not by me, but
by the persons who drew them, and the pack has
since been shuffled again. It is therefore
obviously impossible that I should know either
what cards have been chosen, or whereabouts they
may now be in the pack. But I enjoy impossibilities.
The more impossible a thing is, the more I
want to do it. I will find out these cards or <i>die</i>!
Don’t be alarmed, I don’t mean to die just yet; so
I must do the other thing. It’s easy enough, if
you know how to do it.</p>

<p>“In the first place I cut the pack into three portions.”
(You cut three times, nipping the “long”
corners between second finger and thumb, at each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
of the drawn cards in succession, and placing the
cards left at bottom on one or other of the three
heaps; then solemnly rub your wand, without
remark, with a silk handkerchief, and lay it across
the tops of the three packets.)</p>

<p>“Now, if the electric influence is strong enough,
the three chosen cards will gradually sink down
to the bottom of these three heaps. A nice easy
way of finding them out, is it not? It will take a
minute or two for the charm to operate, so in the
meantime I will try to find out the names of the
cards for myself by thought-reading. You drew
a card, I think, Sir? Will you kindly think of
that card, as hard as you can, and meanwhile look
straight at me? Thank you. Judging by physiognomy,
I should say that you were rather a ladies’
man. Don’t blush, Sir. It’s nothing to be
ashamed of, is it, ladies? But he did blush, didn’t
he? Now, being a ladies’ man, you will naturally
have chosen one of the ladies of the pack, that is to
say one of the queens, and your blush suggests that
it was a red queen. Now there are only two red
queens to choose from. The queen of hearts represents
Love, and the queen of diamonds Money.
If I read your thoughts aright I feel safe in declaring
that you chose the queen of hearts. That is
right, I think? Quite simple, when you know how
it’s done.</p>

<p>“And now, Madam, for your card. I can see at
a glance that you have a liking for aristocratic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
society, and you will therefore naturally have
chosen a king. But which king? Think hard of
your card, please. A picture of a dark-complexioned
gentleman comes up before my mind’s eye,
and I feel that I can say with confidence that
the card you chose was the king of clubs. Am I
right?</p>

<p>“And you, Madam. I have an idea that you
have a taste for pretty things, particularly jewellery.
Such being the case, you would naturally
choose diamonds. Think of your card, please.
Thank you. I see I was right in my guess. The
card you chose was the ten of diamonds.</p>

<p>“And now to verify my discoveries. If my
wand has done its work, those same three cards will
now have percolated through the rest, and settled
down at the bottom of these three heaps. Let us
see whether they have done so.” (The three heaps
are turned over.) “Yes, here we have them: the
king of clubs, the queen of hearts, and the ten of
diamonds. It is a curious thing for the cards to
do, and I daresay you would like to know how it is
done. As a matter of fact, it is done by synthetic
re-adjustment of dissociated atoms. You don’t
know what that means, perhaps? Well, to say the
truth, I don’t quite know myself, but that is the
scientific explanation, so no doubt it is correct.”</p>

<p>The trick may very well end at this point, but
if the reader possesses a card-box, or other apparatus
adapted for “vanishing” cards, he may bring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
it to a still more striking conclusion. In this case
he may continue as follows:</p>

<p>“Now, I should like to show you a curious effect
of sympathy. I take away these three cards and
hand the rest of the pack to the gentleman who
drew the queen of hearts. Kindly hold it up above
your head where all can see it. The three drawn
cards” (show them one by one) “I place in this
box. Again I electrify my wand a little, and lay
it across the box. Now I want each gentleman or
lady to think of his or her card. Think of it
kindly, and feel as if you would like to see it again.
Think hard, please, because it is you, not I, that
perform this experiment, and if you don’t think
hard it will be a failure. I am pleased to see by
the expression of your countenances that you are
all thinking hard. Thank you very much. You
may leave off now. The deed is done. The three
cards have left the box, and gone back to the pack.
Please look it through, sir, and tell the company
whether it is not so.”</p>

<p>The reader, being familiar with the wiles of conjurers,
will doubtless have guessed that the three
cards supposed to have returned to the pack have
in fact never left it, being those naturally belonging
to it, corresponding with the three long cards.
But to the outsider their supposed return will be,
in the words of the lamented Lord Dundreary,
“one of those things that no fellow can understand.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>As regards the disappearance of the three cards,
the performer is of course by no means restricted
to the use of the card-box. If he is an expert in
sleight-of-hand, he may with even better effect,
“vanish” them one by one by means of the back
palm, dropping them a moment later into the profonde.</p>

<h3>THE MASCOT COIN BOX</h3>

<p>This is a little device on the same principle as
the well-known flat card-box, but adapted for use
with coins, and with an addition which largely
increases its utility inasmuch as it will not only
enable the performer to “change” or “vanish,”
but to get instant and secret possession of a coin
placed in it.</p>

<p>The box (see Fig. 14) is of ebonized wood,
unpolished, and in size about three inches square.
It consists of two parts (<i>a</i> and <i>b</i>), which are
alike in size and appearance, so that either half
may be regarded as “box” and either as “lid,” at
pleasure, according as the one or the other is made
uppermost, no difference being perceptible between
them. In the centre of each half is a circular
well, not quite two inches in diameter.</p>

<p>Used with the box is a thin disc of wood corresponding
to that of which the box is made. This
is of such diameter as to fall easily from the one
well into the other, according to the way in which
the box is turned, but on the other hand fits so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
closely within that its presence or absence is not
perceptible to sight. If a coin be laid in the box
upon the disc and the box is then closed and turned
over, the disc settles down over the coin in the
opposite half, either leaving the box apparently
empty or exhibiting in place of the original coin a
substitute with which the opposite side of the box
has been previously loaded.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 220px;">
<img src="images/figure14.jpg" width="220" height="300" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 14</span></p>
</div>

<p>Thus far, as the reader will doubtless have perceived,
the effect produced (save that a coin instead
of a card is dealt with) is precisely the same as in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
the case of the card-box. But the “mascot” has
a speciality of its own, in the fact that in that half
of the box marked <i>a</i> (see Fig. 14) a horizontal
slot is cut on the side opposite to the hinge, just
long enough and wide enough to allow the passage
of a half-crown. The wood being dead black, this
small opening is invisible save to close inspection,
which the box is never called upon to undergo.</p>

<p>When it is desired to gain secret possession of a
coin lent by one of the company, the lender is
invited to place it himself in the box, held open
bookwise as in Fig. 14, the side <i>b</i> of the box having
been previously loaded with a duplicate coin.</p>

<p>The lender of the coin may place it in whichever
side of the box he pleases, but the manner of closing
the box will vary accordingly. If he places it
in the side <i>a</i>, the opposite (or loaded) side is treated
as the lid and turned down over <i>a</i>. In this case,
the coin being already in the slotted half, no turn-over
of the box is necessary, the performer having
merely to allow the coin to slip out into his hand.
In the opposite case, viz., that of the coin being
placed in <i>b</i>, <i>a</i> is treated as the lid, and the coin
being in this case <i>above</i> the disc the box must be
turned over before it can be extracted. If preferred
the performer can hold the box so that the
coin will naturally be placed in <i>b</i>, but in this case
the turn-over is unavoidable.</p>

<p>When the box is again opened, the duplicate coin
is revealed in place of the original, which is meanwhile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
dealt with as may be necessary for the purpose
of the trick. After the borrowed coin has
been extracted, the further fall of the disc closes
the slot, and bars any possibility of the substitute
coin escaping in the same way.</p>

<p>The following will be found an easy way of
working the exchange.</p>

<p>“For the purpose of my next experiment,” says
the performer, “I shall have to ask the loan of a
half-crown; marked in such a way that you can
be sure of knowing it again. I should like one, if
possible, that has seen some service, for a coin in
the course of circulation imbibes a certain amount
of magnetic fluid from each person who handles it;
and this renders a well-worn coin more susceptible
to magical influences than a new one.”</p>

<p>The reason alleged for asking the loan of an old
coin is of course “spoof,” but there <i>is</i> a reason;
and it is two-fold. In the first place it ensures your
getting a coin tolerably like your own; which you
have chosen in accordance with that description,
and which you have marked after some commonplace
fashion, say with a cross scratched upon one
of its faces. Secondly, a well-worn coin, having
lost the sharp edge which is caused by the milling
in a new one, passes the more easily through the
slot, which for obvious reasons is kept as narrow as
possible.</p>

<p>Performer, advancing toward the person offering
the coin, continues:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t want even to touch the coin myself till
the very last moment, so I will ask you meanwhile
to put it in this little box. I believe it was built for
a watch-case, but as I don’t happen to need one, I
use it to hold my money, when I have any, or when
I can get somebody to lend me some.”</p>

<p>The box is held open bookwise, as above mentioned,
and closed according to circumstances, in
one or the other of the two ways described.</p>

<p>“I will now ask some gentleman to take charge
of the coin in the box. Who will do so? You will,
Sir? Thank you. But stay! I think I heard
somebody say (it was only said in a whisper but I
heard it) ‘I don’t believe the half crown is in the
box.’ It is very sad to find people so suspicious,
especially when I take such pains to prove that
there is ‘no deception.’ But the gentleman was
wrong, you see.” (He opens box, and shows the
substitute coin.) “Here it is. Take it out, sir,
and keep it in your own hands till I ask you for
it again.”</p>

<p>During the delivery of the patter the borrowed
coin has been extracted, and the coin exhibited in
the box and handed for safe-keeping is, of course,
the substitute. The box, as being no longer needed,
is laid without remark upon the table, and the
trick proceeds, after whatever may have been its
intended fashion.</p>

<h3>MONEY-MAKING MADE EASY</h3>

<p><i>Requirements.</i> Coin mat loaded with two
double pennies, shell side undermost. Lighted
candle and velvet mat (with pocket) on table.</p>

<p><i>Presentation.</i> Performer comes forward with
coin mat hanging down in his right hand (mouth of
loaded space upwards), and asks for the loan of a
penny, marked in some conspicuous way. Receiving
it on the mat, he shows it, so placed, to the persons,
seated on each side of the owner, in so doing
making it obvious to them, without remark, that
his hands are otherwise empty. Then returning to
his table, with the mat and the coin on it still in
his hand, he delivers patter to the following effect:</p>

<p>“Now I am going to show you a nice easy way
of making money. I was told when I was a small
boy, ‘Take care of the pence, and the pounds will
take care of themselves.’ I believe they do. The
pounds take such good care of themselves that very
few of them seem to come my way. But you can
make a bit even with pennies, if you know how to
set about it. All you need is a really good penny
to start with. It doesn’t matter how you get the
penny. You may beg, borrow, or steal it. Personally,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
I prefer to borrow it. If you try the other
two ways you get yourself disliked, but you can
always get people to lend you things, if you ask
prettily; and I’ve always been celebrated for my
nice borrowing manner. You must all have noticed
that the gentleman lent me a penny without
the slightest hesitation. I daresay if I had asked
him, he would have made it two-pence, or even six-pence,
if he had as much about him. In this case,
however, one penny is enough for my purpose;
and here it is with the owner’s own mark upon it.
Observe that it is just a plain ordinary penny, and
you can see for yourselves that it is the only one
I have&mdash;in my hands, I mean. I am always truthful.
As a matter of fact, I believe I have another
in my left trouser-pocket, but I promise you that
I won’t use it.”</p>

<p>Pass mat, with coin on it, from one hand to the
other, showing the hands otherwise empty, and
leaving the mat finally in the right hand: then let
the marked coin slide off it into left hand, the
concealed coins passing with it. Put down the
mat, and show all three coins together (the marked
coin in front) held between forefinger and thumb,
broadside toward the spectators. Thus held, they
are, even at a few feet distant, undistinguishable
from a single coin.</p>

<p>“Now I am going to make money. Not much,
perhaps, in fact only a penny at a time. I shall
start by making this one penny into two. Cent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
per cent is not bad, is it? Observe, I use no violence.
It’s all done by kindness. I just warm the
coin a little over this candle-flame. That softens
the metal and I am able to squeeze another penny
out of this one, <i>so</i>!”</p>

<p>Show as two accordingly, by sliding off the
hindermost coin in its shell, exhibiting it on both
sides, and laying it on the table.</p>

<p>“You have all heard of turning an honest penny.
Well, this is one way of doing it. It is said, too,
that one good turn deserves another, so we’ll try
again. I warm the first penny a little more, and
again I pull another out of it.” (Draw second
double coin from behind the original penny.)
“Now we have three, two in my hands” (showing
one in each hand) “and one on the table.</p>

<p>“I think I heard somebody say that I couldn’t
make any more? I don’t like to do it, because the
process takes a good deal out of the original penny,
and I might spoil it. On the other hand, I don’t
like to decline a challenge, so here goes! I warm
these two again, and then, with a little extra pressure,
because it naturally becomes more difficult
each time, I get yet another penny, as you see.
So now, in all, we have four.” (Show those in
hand as three, by drawing solid coin out of shell,
then, picking up double coin from mat, show as four
accordingly.) “Did I hear a lady say ‘Just one
more’? Well, then, one more.” (Develop the
double coin just picked up, and show as five.)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
“But here I must really draw the line. If I kept
on like this, there would be none of the original
penny left. It is already getting weaker and
weaker. Besides, there wouldn’t be time for anything
else, and I have several still more wonderful
things to show you.</p>

<p>“And now to put these extra pennies back again
into the original coin. At present it is only one-fifth
its proper weight and if the owner tried to
pass it in this condition there would be trouble.
I should explain, by the way, that these others are
not really solid coins: though they look like it.
They are what the spiritualists call astral coins,
if you know what that means: I don’t quite know
myself; so I won’t attempt to explain, but I believe
in the Police Courts they are known as ‘duffers.’”</p>

<p>Lay all five coins on the velvet mat, each of the
shells slightly overlapping the solid coin to which
it belongs.</p>

<p>“Here we have one, two, three, four, five. I
pick up two of them.” (Draw shell over solid in
act of picking up.) “I give them a gentle squeeze
and they become one only.” (Show as one, and
replace on mat behind the mouth of pocket.)
“Now I treat two more in the same way.”
(Repeat accordingly, replacing these also, as one,
on mat.) “We have now only three left. Let me
see, which is the original? Ah! here it is, with the
owner’s mark upon it.” (Pick it up and show in
left hand.) “Now I rub one of these others into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
it.” (Make the movement of picking up one of
the double coins, and of rubbing it into the coin in
left hand, but in reality “vanish” it, in the supposed
act of picking up, into the pocket of mat.)
“And now I pass this other one into it in the
same way, and we have only the original penny left.
It is like the ten little niggers, isn’t it, only that
they never came back. Here is your penny, Sir.
Please observe that it still has your own mark
upon it, which is proof positive that there has
been ‘no deception.’”</p>

<p>N. B. If the performer is a novice, he may
simplify the trick by loading the coin mat with
one double and one ordinary coin only, or two
ordinary coins, limiting the successive productions
accordingly.</p>

<h3>THE MISSING LINK</h3>

<p>At an early period of my magical career, I
devised a trick to which I gave the name of <i>Concatenation
Extraordinary</i>, and which will be found
described in <i>Later Magic</i>, page 94. In effect it
consisted of the magical welding of a number of
loose iron links into a continuous chain. It was
performed by the aid of a Black Art table, a bottomless
tumbler, and a silk thread. “Though I
say it that shouldn’t,” it was an ingenious trick,
and I was very proud of it. Unfortunately, some
good natured friend (I rather think it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
Mr. David Devant) pointed out to me that about
ninety-five per cent of my ingenuity was wasted,
inasmuch as the same effect, so far as the spectator
was concerned, could be produced by infinitely
simpler means, viz.:&mdash;by using a glass with double
mirror partition, when all the other paraphernalia
became unnecessary. You had only to load the
hinder compartment with the complete chain, and
after a due amount of “talkee-talkee,” drop the
loose links into the forward one, turn the glass
round, and the deed was done.</p>

<p>The trick, as a trick, was just as good in its new
shape as before, but being at that time (comparatively)
young and foolish, its extreme simplicity
spoilt it for me, and I lost all interest in it. Not
long since, however, I was reminded of it by coming
across the chain and links which had figured in
my performance of the trick, and it struck me that,
in a slightly modified form, it may still be worth
the attention of the drawing-room conjurer.</p>

<p>The requirements for the trick in this, its latest
form, are as follows:</p>

<p>First, the mirror glass; and as to this I may note
in passing that the “mirror” is best made of tin-plate,
not too highly polished, in place of the looking-glass
plate which was, until a quite recent
period, generally employed for the purpose.</p>

<p>Secondly, a length of small iron chain, made up
of twenty-six links, connected in the centre by a
twenty-seventh link of brass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>Thirdly, two shorter lengths of similar chain,
consisting of thirteen links each, and a loose brass
link, corresponding to the one in the centre of the
longer chain. The complete chain is to be placed
at the outset in the hinder compartment of the
mirror glass, which should be of such a size that
the chain nearly fills it.</p>

<p>Lastly will be needed a bottle containing Eau de
Cologne, of which a few drops have been poured
on the chain in the glass.</p>

<p>The patter may run to something like the following
effect.</p>

<p>“You are doubtless aware, ladies and gentlemen,
that electricity is now largely employed in the
welding of metals. Of course to produce such a
result on a large scale, such as welding guns, enormous
strength of current is required; amounting
in fact to millions of ampères, or volts, or ohms, or
watts. I blush to confess I don’t know which is
which, but it’s of no consequence. If I had ever
so many ampères, or the rest of it, I shouldn’t know
what to do with them. I am only able to manufacture
my electricity on a very small scale, but
with the aid of a little magic, I get very good
results.</p>

<p>“You are also no doubt aware that when certain
metals, particularly copper and zinc, are brought
into close connection, an electrical current is set
up between them. The same thing applies, in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
less degree, to iron and brass, as I hope to be able
to show you.</p>

<p>“I have here two short lengths of iron chain.
Will somebody be kind enough to count the links?
You will find, I think, that there are exactly
thirteen in each. Please notice this, because, in
some mysterious way, it has something to do with
the success of my experiment. You know thirteen
is an unlucky number, and the chains themselves
don’t like to consist of that number of links, and
if they can alter it, they try to do so. I am going
to give them the opportunity, with a little electrical
assistance. Thirteen, as I have said, is an unlucky
number, and twice thirteen makes twenty-six,
which is not much better, but if you add one more,
you get twenty-seven, which is a very lucky number
indeed. Everybody knows that three is a
lucky number. Three times three are nine, which
of course must be luckier still, and three times nine
are twenty-seven, which is naturally best of all.</p>

<p>“Now I am going to give these two chains an
opportunity to convert themselves into that lucky
number, by taking in this extra link, which as you
perceive is brass, an opposition metal. Observe,
I drop one of the chains into this glass. See that
I do so fairly. Then I drop in the single link,
and lastly, the other piece of chain. And now, in
order to set up an electrical reaction, I add just a
few drops from this bottle of Eau de Cologne. As
a matter of fact, a little salt and water would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
the same effect, but I use Eau de Cologne because
it smells nicer. And now I must ask the loan of
some lady’s handkerchief, to cover the glass, and
concentrate the electric current.”</p>

<p>Holding the handkerchief in right hand, pick
up the glass with left hand, and raise it a few
inches from the table. In lowering it, cover it with
the handkerchief, and at the same time give it the
necessary half-turn. Take out your watch, and
make believe to time the operation, remarking, “I
find it needs a full half-minute, to allow the charm
to work. Time! Let us see how we have succeeded.”</p>

<p>Take off the handkerchief, and draw the chain
slowly out of the glass. “Yes. All is well. I
should say welded, and I trust you will say, ‘Well
done.’ The chain is complete, and now consists of
twenty-seven links, the lucky number. Perhaps
some gentleman will verify the fact.</p>

<p>“I must tell you frankly that I don’t guarantee
the correctness of my explanation. I can’t say
exactly how much the electricity has to do with it.
I only know that if you go to work the right way,
which means, do as I do, you get the result, and
there you are. This experiment always provokes
a lot of discussion. The other evening one gentleman
said it was done this way. A lady said it was
that way, and a sharp boy (the younger they are
the more they know) was quite sure it was done
another way altogether. But they were all wrong.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
It is done just the way I have shown you, and if
you do as I do, and say as I say, you will no doubt
produce the same result.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> If you don’t, well, you
will be no use as a conjurer, and you had better
go into some other business.”</p>

<p>Some less instructed reader may possibly
enquire, “But why the Eau de Cologne? What
does that do?” Precisely nothing, and therein lies
its virtue. As indicated in the section on “patter”
(<i>post</i>) it often happens that some little bit of
spoof, supererogatory in reality so far as the spectator
is concerned, is accepted as covering the real
key to the puzzle. This is a case in point. Taking
it for granted that the Eau de Cologne would not
be used without <i>some</i> reason, the spectator sets to
work to discover that reason, and so gets farther
from the real solution.</p>

<h3>CULTURE EXTRAORDINARY</h3>

<p>The root-idea of this item must be credited to
Signor Antonio Molini, the inventor of the very
effective stage trick known as <i>Le Souper du
Diable</i>. The principle on which that trick is
worked is so subtle, and withal so simple, that it is
surprising that it has not long since been applied
to the production of less bulky objects than the
tablecloth, eatables and drinkables which figure in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
the Satanic supper. The following is an application
of the Signor Molini’s idea on a scale better
adapted to the drawing room.</p>

<p><i>Requisites.</i></p>

<p>(1) Three zinc or zinc-lined tubes, as <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, in
Fig. 15, ranging in height from about three inches
upwards, and graduated in size so as to fit easily
one within the other.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/figure15.jpg" width="450" height="290" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 15</span></p>
</div>

<p>(2) Three balls, one red and two white, of such
diameter as to pass easily through the narrowest
tube. Two smaller balls, one red and one white,
about half an inch in diameter.</p>

<p>(3) A box of matches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>Each of the two smaller tubes (<i>c</i> and <i>d</i> in diagram)
to be loaded with one of the larger white
balls, suspended from the upper edge of the tube
by a wire hook, shaped as <i>a</i> in Fig. 16, connected
with the ball by a loop of fine silk or cotton thread.
The red ball is vested, and the two little balls may
rest in a shallow tray or other appropriate receptacle
on the table, deep enough as to conceal them
from the view of the spectators.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/figure16.jpg" width="200" height="300" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 16</span></p>
</div>

<p><i>Introductory Patter.</i> “You have no idea, ladies
and gentlemen, what a lot of hints I get from different
people for the improvement of my entertainment.
If I were to adopt them all, I have no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
doubt it would be very fine indeed. The worst of
it is that it would take a year or two to try them,
so for the present I am obliged to leave things as
they are.</p>

<p>“You will observe that I have here three tubes”
(showing No. 1 and passing wand through it to
prove it is empty), “quite ordinary tubes, with a
hole at each end, and nothing at all between. I
don’t suppose you would notice anything to object
to about them, but some people are so very particular.
A gentleman who said he had an artistic
eye (I don’t know which eye it was) said to me,
‘Look here, Professor, that trick of yours would be
ever so much better if you had all those tubes the
same size. That lot looks as if you had picked
them up at a jumble sale.’<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> I explained to him,
kindly but firmly, that there was a special reason
for having the three tubes of different sizes;
namely, that by so doing it was made possible”
(suiting the action to the word) “to pass this one
(No. 1) over this other (No. 2); and this again
over the smallest one, thereby saving much space
in packing. He said, ‘Never mind, you take my
tip and make ’em all the same size.’ I dare say
he was right, but I haven’t had time to do it yet.”</p>

<p>During this little harangue, which appears to be
mere “spoof,” you have practically worked the
trick. Suiting the action to the word, you have
passed the largest tube No. 1 over No. 2 and lifted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
it off again. In its downward movement the tube
passes over the little hook on No. 2; but in lifting
it off again its upper edge comes within the outer
arm of the hook, and carries this off with the ball
attached to it, leaving tube No. 2 empty. The latter,
shown empty accordingly, is passed over No.
3 and carries off its load in the same way.</p>

<p>You have thus proved (!) in the most convincing
way that all three tubes are empty, though as
a matter of fact No. 3 is the only one in that condition,
Nos. 1 and 2 each containing a suspended
ball.</p>

<p>The patter from this point may vary according
to the fancy of the performer. If he has the knack
of producing the appropriate combination of fact
and fiction, it is preferable that he should do so for
himself. As I have elsewhere remarked, borrowed
patter rarely comes so “trippingly on the
tongue” as that of which the performer can say
with, let us hope, undue depreciation of his merits,
“a poor thing, but mine own.”</p>

<p>The fable with which I should myself introduce
the trick would run somewhat as follows:</p>

<p>“You have all heard, ladies and gentlemen, of
intensive culture, gooseberries grown while you
wait, and that sort of thing. It is done by enclosing
the seed, or the young plant, in a confined space
and keeping it warm and comfy. It has always
seemed to me that there is a good deal of magic
about the process, and I thought I would like to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
try it myself, but it would be no good my trying
to grow vegetables. I shouldn’t have room to
grow more than one radish, or one spring onion
at a time, which would hardly be worth while. I
finally decided to grow a few billiard balls, for use
in my entertainment, and I’ll show you how it’s
done.</p>

<p>“You must please imagine that these three tubes
are three hothouses on the new system.” (Picks
up and exhibits one of the little white balls.) “Of
course everything has to be raised from seed in the
first instance, but it would take too long to show
you the whole process from the beginning, so we
will start with this little ball, grown from seed last
night. In its present condition it is too small to
be of any use, but by means of my intensive culture
we can soon make it grow larger. I will drop
it into No. 1 forcing house.”</p>

<p>Performer shows little ball in right hand and
makes believe to transfer it to the left, in reality
rolling it, as in the well-known “Cups and Balls”
trick, between the roots of the second and third
fingers. The left hand, held above tube No. 1,
makes the movement of crumbling an imaginary
ball into it. “Now we will plant another in the
same way.”</p>

<p>You pick up apparently another little white ball,
but in reality the same; which has remained in the
right hand. Now, however, it will be well to vary
the sleight used, so you show the ball between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
second finger and thumb of the left hand, and
apparently take it back by means of the pincette
or tourniquet; then professedly dropping it into
the second tube.</p>

<p>“And now, to complete the set, we shall have to
grow a red ball. Here is a seedling of that colour.”
You pick up the little red ball, and make
believe to pass it after the same fashion into the
third tube.</p>

<p>“And now to supply the heat. We do not need
much, the space being so confined. I find that even
the flame of a match is sufficient.”</p>

<p>You strike a match and move the flame round
and round within the top of the larger tube till the
thread catches fire and releases the ball. Should
this be heard to drop, you account for it by remarking
“I dare say you noticed a little explosion.
That is caused by the sudden radio-activity of the
component atoms re-arranging themselves in the
expanded form.” You raise the tube and show
the ball: then go through the same process with
the second tube. Under cover of raising this tube
to show the ball, you get the large red ball from the
vest into the left hand and palm it.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you would like to watch the progress
a little more closely.” You pick up the third tube
and place it upright on the palm of the left hand,
in so doing introducing the palmed ball from
below, and advance with it to the company.</p>

<p>“The red balls are especially sensitive to heat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
Even the warmth of the breath is generally enough
for these. Anyhow, we will try.” You breathe
into the tube, and lifting it show the ball, then
offering both tube and ball for inspection.</p>

<p>It will hardly be necessary to point out to the
acute reader that the alteration of procedure in
the case of the last tube is rendered necessary; first,
by the fact that the tube up to that point contains
no ball, and secondly in order to avoid the difficulty
of striking a match with the right hand only, the
left being otherwise occupied.</p>

<p>The trick may appropriately be followed by the
exhibition of a few of the usual ball sleights. If
it is worked on a “black art” table it may be
brought to an effective close by the “dematerialisation,”
in succession, of the three balls.</p>

<h3>THE BOUNDING BEANS</h3>

<p>This is another application of the principle
introduced by Signor Molini and utilised in the
trick last described.</p>

<p>The requisites for the trick are as follows:</p>

<p>(1) Mirror glass; at the outset, empty.</p>

<p>(2) Two tubes of cardboard, sheet brass, or zinc,
as A and B in Fig. 17. The height and width of
A are about 3½ and 2½ inches respectively. B is
a little taller, but a trifle less in diameter.</p>

<p>(3) A third tube, C, with its lower edge turned
inward an eighth of an inch all around. This tube<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
is a little shorter than A, and in diameter a trifle
smaller than B, which must pass easily over it.
Attached to either side of its upper edge, outside,
are soldered two little wire hooks, the points on the
outside directed downwards.</p>

<p>(4) A coil of paper ribbon, of such size as to fit
closely into the lower end of C, and forming, when
so placed, a temporary bottom to it. The inner
end of the coil must be drawn up an inch or so,
so as to form a little cone in the centre.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/figure17.jpg" width="450" height="230" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 17</span></p>
</div>

<p>(5) A similar coil unwound into a loose mass
of paper ribbon.</p>

<p>(6) About three-quarters of a pint of haricot
beans. Of these a sufficient number must be
poured into C (around the little cone), to fill it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
The remainder are to be brought forward on some
sort of tray.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>C loaded as last described, is to be placed
within B.</p>

<p>The trick may be introduced as follows:</p>

<p>“Most of you, I dare say, have seen the little
natural curiosity known as the Jumping Bean.
To all appearance these are just like other beans;
but if you spread a dozen or so of them on the
table and watch them carefully, you presently see
one or more of them turn over, or even make a little
jump. A young and lively bean will sometimes
hop as far as half an inch.</p>

<p>“Scientific gentlemen tell us that their agility is
caused by a little insect inside the bean. When
he wags his tail, or scratches himself with his hind
leg, it causes the bean to turn over, or to make a
hop. That seems to me rather a lame explanation
because there is no hole in the bean that the insect
could possibly have got in at. I believe myself,
that they are in truth magic beans, and I have been
trying to train some beans of my own to do the
same thing on a larger scale, and in such a way
that you can all see them do it.</p>

<p>“Here are my beans.” (Show those on tray.)
“Examine them as much as you like. The more
you examine them, the more you won’t find anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
particular about them. You won’t notice
any difference between them and any other beans,
but as a matter of fact they are a good deal more
energetic than beans of the ordinary kind, and
when they get to know and love you, they will do
all sorts of remarkable things.</p>

<p>“I will pour a few of them into this glass.”
(The front compartment of the mirror glass is
filled to about two-thirds of its height.) “To prevent
their getting out again without your knowing
it I will press them down with a handful of these
pretty paper shavings.”</p>

<p>This is also done, the quantity of paper being so
regulated, in accordance with previous experiment,
that when pressed down it shall come half
an inch or so below the brim of the glass.</p>

<p>“To make matters still more secure I will ask
the loan of a lady’s handkerchief to cover the glass
with.”</p>

<p>The handkerchief is taken in the right hand, the
left meanwhile raising the glass a little way to
meet it. In covering and lowering it again to the
table the needful half-turn is made.</p>

<p>“I will not touch the glass again until the experiment
is finished. Meanwhile I want to call your
attention to these two tubes. You will observe
that one of them is slightly larger than the other.
A gentleman told me the other evening that I was
wrong in saying so. He maintained that the one
was smaller than the other. I didn’t argue with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
him. I never do with that sort of man. It is just
a question of the point of view. Anyhow, I had
the one made larger, or the other one smaller,
whichever way it is, so that the one can go comfortably
over the other, like this.”</p>

<p>A, first carelessly moved about so as to show
clearly that it is empty, is brought down over B
and lifted off again, carrying off within it C and
its load; after which B is in turn shown to be
empty.</p>

<p>“Now I am going to order the beans to jump out
of the glass and into one or other of these empty
tubes, at your own choice. Right? or left?
Which shall it be?”</p>

<p>Performer asks the question standing behind his
table, and by means of the familiar equivoque
(“my” or “your” left or right) interprets the
answer to mean A.</p>

<p>“And now I have only to pronounce the proper
magic spell. The trouble is to remember the right
one. They are rather confusing, and if you happen
to pronounce the wrong one, or even pronounce
the right one the wrong way, the consequences may
be serious. But I think I know this one pretty
well. ‘Peripatetico-paticocorum.’ I fancy I
have got it right. I don’t know quite what it
means myself, and nobody seems to be able to tell
me. A Japanese gentleman told me he thought it
was Spanish, but a Spaniard said he felt sure it
was Welsh. Somebody else suggested that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
should ‘ask a pleeceman.’ I did ask a policeman,
and he said, ‘Go to&mdash;’ somewhere I won’t mention,
but I don’t think he meant it as a translation. My
own idea is that it is a bit of Esperanto. Anyhow,
it has the desired effect; for you see the beans have
left the glass” (uncovering it and showing it
empty), “and they have jumped into this tube,
which is what I wanted them to do.”</p>

<p>The beans are poured from the tube into the
vacant portion, now to the front, of the mirror
glass, with due care that the coil at bottom shall not
be seen.</p>

<p>“But there’s something wrong here. I must
have made some little mistake in the pronunciation
of the magic spell, for the paper seems to have disappeared
as well as the beans. There is certainly
no room for it in the tube. Here it is, though, or
some of it.”</p>

<p>The paper is unwound, and when it comes to
an end the wand is passed through A and C (now
bottomless) together, again proving (?) that the
former which is always shown to the spectators
could not possibly have contained the beans
in any natural way. A moment or two later the
inner tube can easily be got rid of behind the mass
of paper ribbon.</p>

<h3>LOST AND FOUND</h3>

<p>This trick may be worked either upon a black
art table or black art mat. We will assume that
the latter is used.</p>

<p>The requisites for this trick will in such case
be as follows:</p>

<p>1. The mat. This may be a small circular one,
a few inches in circumference without pocket.</p>

<p>2. A handkerchief, fourteen or fifteen inches
square, of some gaudy pattern, carefully folded
and placed in a square Japanese handkerchief box.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>3. A circular velvet patch as described <i>ante</i>, in
the chapter dealing with novel applications of the
Black Art principle.</p>

<p>4. A half-crown placed in a pochette, or otherwise
so as to be readily get-at-able.</p>

<p><i>Presentation.</i> Performer opens the box and
takes out the handkerchief, which he carefully
unfolds, handling it as if it were something of
extraordinary value.</p>

<p>“I have here, ladies, a curio of an exceptionally
curious kind. This is said to be the identical
handkerchief which Othello gave to Desdemona,
and which afterwards caused so much unpleasantness.
No doubt you all know your Shakespeare,
and will remember that Othello tells his wife,
‘There’s magic in the web of it.’ And there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
magic in it still. Not so much as there was, I dare
say, but still it retains a good many magical qualities.
Among them is a curious talent for recovering
lost property. For instance, I once had a dog.
His name was Socrates, but he was generally called
‘Socks.’ In fact, he preferred it. He was a valuable
dog, because he combined so many different
breeds. He was partly pug, and partly greyhound,
and partly dachshund, and partly chow,
and partly bull-dog and partly terrier, and partly
of two or three other breeds that I can’t for the
moment remember. One day Socks went out to see
a friend, and didn’t come back again. I sat up all
night for him with a stick, but he didn’t come home
till morning. In fact, he didn’t come home even
then. I thought I had lost him for good, and I
was quite distressed about it.</p>

<p>“Just when I was beginning to get over the loss
I had a further shock. My precious Desdemona
handkerchief was missing. But the very next day
I heard a barking outside, and there was my dog
with the handkerchief tied round his neck and
three other dogs with him. The handkerchief had
recovered them all.</p>

<p>“You don’t believe that little story. I thought
you wouldn’t. People never will believe anything
a little bit out of the way. It is just the same with
fish stories. I know a man who, when he was a
boy, fishing in a pond with a maggot on a bent pin,
caught a four-pound salmon. He didn’t claim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
any credit for doing it. He says himself it was
just an accident, and might have happened to anybody.
But he never can get anyone to believe him,
and it has spoilt his character. He was naturally
a truthful man, but being always disbelieved has
made him reckless, and now, whenever he tells the
story he sticks another half-pound on to the salmon.
I believe it is a fifteen pounder now.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>“With regard to the handkerchief, however, I
can easily prove to you that what I have stated is
correct. I can’t prove it quite in the same way,
because even if any lady or gentleman present
had lost a dog, it would take the handkerchief a
day or two to find it, and you would get tired of
waiting. So I must show you the virtues of the
handkerchief in a simpler way.</p>

<p>“Will some gentleman oblige me with the loan
of a half-crown, marked so that he can be sure of
knowing it again?”</p>

<p>On receiving the coin the performer returns to
his table, holding it on high so that it can be seen
that there is no substitution, and lays it on the
black art mat.</p>

<p>“Presently I propose to lose this coin, and get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
the handkerchief to find it, but first you would like,
no doubt, to have a look at the handkerchief itself.
Notice the richness of the pattern. It is said to
be after a design in the Alhambra. I don’t mean
the Alhambra you gentlemen go to, but the real
Moorish one in Spain.”</p>

<p>Leaving the handkerchief for the time being in
the possession of a spectator he returns to the
table, meanwhile palming the velvet patch, and the
substituted half-crown, and ostensibly picks up
the original, in reality rendering it invisible by
laying the patch over it, and showing the substitute
in its place, after the manner described at <a href="#Page_19">p. 19</a>.
He then advances to the company with the substitute
coin and offers it to one or other of the spectators,
remarking, “Take it, please, and pass it to
one or other of your neighbours so that I shan’t
know where it is.”</p>

<p>Under pretence of offering the coin, he passes
it from the one hand to the other, and vanishes it
by, say, the tourniquet, so that the person holding
out a hand to receive it gets nothing, and says so.</p>

<p>“What do you say, Sir? You have not got it?
But surely, I have just handed it to you. You are
not joking? Then it must have fallen on the floor.
Please look around you a bit.” (Pretends to do
so himself.) “Not there? Well, this is extraordinary.”
(To the lender of the coin.) “I am
very sorry, Sir. Your money is lost in a way I
did not anticipate. But after all, when I come to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
think of it, it’s of no consequence. The handkerchief
will find it wherever it is, even if it has to
follow it into somebody’s pocket. By the way,
where is the handkerchief?” He takes it from the
person with whom it was left, and holding it by
two of its corners, and showing both hands otherwise
empty, lowers it down carefully over the
black patch on table.</p>

<p>“And now to work the spell. ‘Bismillah!
Bechesm! Salaam Aleikoum!’ You must excuse
my speaking Arabic, but that is the only language
the handkerchief understands. I see that the gentleman
who lent me the half-crown is looking a
little bit anxious. Cheer up, Sir, the handkerchief
has never failed me yet. But we must give it time.
Say, half a minute.” (Looks at watch.) “This
is curious. Half a minute gone. One minute,
and nothing has happened. The handkerchief has
made no move. Something must have gone wrong.
But stay! If the handkerchief has not gone to the
coin, perhaps the coin has gone to the handkerchief.
Let us see!”</p>

<p>He lifts the handkerchief by the centre, picking
up the black patch with it, and thereby disclosing
the coin, which is handed back on the mat to the
owner. Then carefully folding up the handkerchief,
performer replaces it in its box, and in so
doing regains possession of the velvet patch, to be
got rid of at a convenient opportunity.</p>

<h3>THE RIDDLE OF THE PYRAMIDS</h3>

<p>This, in good hands, will be found a very effective
trick. I have the less hesitation in saying so,
because the assertion is only to a very limited
extent self-praise. The idea of the effect to be produced
was my own, as also to a certain extent the
method of producing it. I had even got so far as
to devise, in anticipation, suitable patter. When,
however, I proceeded to put my ideas into practice
I found myself pulled up by unexpected obstacles.</p>

<p>The object to be attained, as will be seen by the
sequel, was the instantaneous re-adjustment of the
sundered parts of a small pyramid, and this I proposed
to do by means of the pull of a thread, fine
enough to be practically invisible. Now, to make
segments of a pyramid not only draw together,
but sit squarely one upon another, it is necessary
to have forces operating simultaneously in two different
directions, and the need for this caused difficulties
which I found myself unable to cope with.
Indeed, I had practically decided to content myself
by producing a somewhat similar effect in a simpler
way, as exemplified in the trick which I have
called the <i>Miracle of Mumbo Jumbo</i>, which next
follows.</p>

<p>As luck would have it, however, I mentioned my
difficulties to my good friend, Mr. Holt Schooling,
a gentleman whom I have more than once had
occasion to refer to in my writings in connection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
with some neat device. Mr. Schooling declared
that the original idea was too good to be abandoned,
and offered to try his hand at bringing it to a successful
issue. I must frankly confess that I had
no great hope of his success; but Mr. Schooling is
a man of many talents. Apart from eminence in
his own profession (that of actuary and statistician)
he is not only an expert amateur conjurer,
but an exceptionally skilful mechanic, and he
possesses withal an unlimited capacity for taking
pains. He used these qualities to such good purpose
that I am enabled to include this striking
effect among the contents of the present volume.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/figure18.jpg" width="250" height="200" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 18</span></p>
</div>

<p>The principal item of apparatus is naturally the
pyramid itself, which is of blackened wood as
illustrated in Fig. 18. For the sake of lightness it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
is of necessity a small affair, being four inches in
height, about six across the base, and two across
the top. It is divided into five horizontal slabs or
segments, as indicated by the dotted lines. Midway
on each side of each slab, at about half an inch
distance from the upper edge, a minute hole is
bored, parallel to the outer slope of the segment;
exactness in this particular being an essential condition
of success. Of the four holes in each slab,
two only are actually used in the trick, the other
two being added partly for the sake of uniformity,
and partly to disguise the significance of the other
pair. Each slab, save those at the top and bottom,
is also perforated perpendicularly by three or four
holes of considerable diameter, the object of these
being merely to lessen the weight of the slab.</p>

<p>In preparing the pyramid for use in the trick, a
piece of plaited silk fishing-line, stained black, and
in length five to six feet, is passed by the aid of a
needle upwards through the small hole in one side
of the largest slab; then in the same way through
the corresponding hole in the next, and so on till it
comes out through the uppermost. Thence it is
again passed downward through the next adjoining
hole in each slab till it comes out at the bottom,
when the ends are drawn level and tied in a
knot.</p>

<p>The use of plaited silk fishing line for such purposes
is one of Mr. Schooling’s specialties, and is a
“tip” to make a note of. Line of this kind is in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
proportion to its thickness much stronger than
ordinary silk thread, and, not being liable to
untwist, its surface remains permanently hard and
smooth, a great desideratum where it is important
to minimise friction. Further, it does not “kink”
as a twisted thread is liable to do.</p>

<p>Two other items of apparatus are used, viz.:</p>

<p>(1) An electric torch in the shape of a wand, the
light appearing at the end.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 19</span></p>
</div>

<p>(2) A little knife or cutter specially designed by
Mr. Schooling for use in this trick. This consists
of a half-inch length of a safety-razor blade, set
in a handle consisting of a piece of tin one inch
square, folded in half, and then bent back to a right
angle on each side, the blade projecting along the
line of juncture as shown in Fig. 19. In use the
cutter is held by what may be called its backbone
between the first joints of the first and second
fingers of the extended hand, as shown in Fig. 20.
This cutter must be placed ready to hand upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
table. It is so minute that there is no fear of its
attracting attention.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In presenting the trick the pyramid, with its sections
duly threaded and placed one upon another,
is brought in on a wooden board similar to an
ordinary drawing-board, measuring twenty-four
inches by sixteen, and like the pyramid itself,
stained black. It is essential to the satisfactory
working of the trick that the “base” section of the
pyramid shall not shift when the thread is pulled.
This is ensured by having two L shaped “stops”
of thin wood glued or screwed to the board near the
left hand corner nearest to the performer when in
use.</p>

<p>The trick may be introduced as follows:</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether any of you ladies and
gentlemen are well up in Egyptology. I can’t say
I am, myself. I know a camel when I see one, but
that is about as far as I have got. There is, however,
one point about it which has always interested
me very much. It is a point which has puzzled
not only the Egyptologists, but all the other
ologists; namely, how the pyramids were built.
They consist, as no doubt you know, of enormous
masses of stone; so large that the cleverest engineers
of our day cannot tell us how they were
placed one upon another. If you can imagine the
lifting of the Royal Exchange in one lump and
dumping it down on the top of the Bank of England,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
you will have some idea of the sort of job
the Egyptian builders had to tackle.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Anyhow,
the work was done, and as it is clear that it could
not have been done by any known mechanical
means, we are compelled to seek some other solution
of the problem.</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether any of you read novels.
If you do, you must often have noticed the curious
way in which fiction constantly anticipates fact.
The novelist describes some utterly impossible
thing, and a few years later some other fellow goes
and does it. Jules Verne described a voyage
under the sea long before the submarine was
invented, and Mr. Wells wrote ‘The War in the
Air’ while the aeroplane and the Zeppelin were
still in their infancy. But there is one conception
of the novelist which has not till now been made
an accomplished fact. That is the force called
‘Vril,’ described by Lord Lytton in his novel, ‘The
Coming Race.’ He describes Vril as a sort of
hyper-electricity capable in the hands of those who
know how to gather and use it, of producing all
sorts of wonders, even to removing mountains.
Imprisoned in a wand and directed by a strong
will, it will shrivel up an enemy or a wild beast as
by a flash of lighting.</p>

<p>“I have always had an idea that this must have
been the force used by the Egyptians to build the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
pyramids. I have managed to collect a small
quantity of an unknown force which answers very
closely to Lord Lytton’s description of Vril, and
I have charged this wand with it. As regards killing
things, I have only tested it so far on a black
beetle. The experiment was a success. He was
blown to atoms, all but one hind leg. I should
like to try it on a tiger; if I could get one cheap.
Does any gentleman present know of a secondhand
tiger in a good strong cage going cheap?
No? I was afraid you wouldn’t. I am hoping
however for a chance of trying it some night on
a burglar. If a gentleman of the Bill Sykes persuasion
should steal into my chamber at dead of
night with felonious designs upon my Waterbury
and my collarstud, he will be as a dead man. I
shall just point this wand at him and say ‘Die,’
and he will be merely a little heap of ashes to be
swept up by the housemaid in the morning.</p>

<p>“I can however give you an example of the power
of my Vril as a motive force. I shall do so by
using it to build or rather rebuild this little pyramid
in your presence.</p>

<p>“This is a correct copy of the real thing. It
takes to pieces, as you see. One, two, three, four,
five!”</p>

<p>As he pronounces the last few words, the performer,
standing behind his table, picks up the
pyramid, and holding it aloft in his right hand
draws away the base from the other sections, sliding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
it along the thread, and “bedding” it between
the “stops” at the left hand bottom corner of the
board. He then slides the other portions, one by
one, along the thread in the same way, laying them
in a row diagonally across the board. This will
have taken up a considerable portion of the thread,
but there will still be a loop some inches in length
hanging down near the left hand corner of the
table.</p>

<p>“Now please watch carefully. This wand, you
will remember, has been carefully charged with
my imitation Vril.”</p>

<p>While speaking these last words the performer
gets one finger of his left hand within the loop.
He now turns on the light at the end of the wand,
and with it makes a quick sweep from right to left
over the severed parts of the pyramid, making at
the same time a half-turn away from the table, and
quickly drawing away the thread. If this is done
neatly the severed parts of the pyramid run
together one upon the other in a single instant.</p>

<p>It is probable that the parts may not sit exactly
one upon another. Whether this is so or not, the
performer makes believe to notice that it is so, as
it gives him a needful opportunity. He remarks:</p>

<p>“The power was hardly strong enough, I see.
There is a block here that needs a little straightening
up.” Having meanwhile picked up the little
cutter between the fingers he bends over the table
and squares up the pyramid as may (or may not)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
be necessary, and under cover of so doing draws
the blade across the thread where it crosses the
top, thereby severing it, and then moving back a
little to note the effect of his correction draws it
away altogether. Shifting the restored pyramid
to the centre of the board he brings all forward for
examination. The severed thread is allowed to
drop on the floor, to be picked up after the performance
is over.</p>

<h3>THE MIRACLE OF MUMBO JUMBO</h3>

<p>The items needed for the presentation of this
trick are as follows:</p>

<p>(1) A miniature pagoda of quaint design. It
consists of five circular sections, resting one upon
another as illustrated in Fig. 21. The trick in
effect consists of the automatic re-adjustment of
these sections after being taken apart and shown
lying apparently haphazard on a Japanese tray.
For drawing-room use the pagoda is about six
inches high and the same diameter across the base.
For stage purposes it may be made a trifle larger.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/figure21.jpg" width="250" height="220" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 21</span></p>
</div>

<p>(2) The tray. This, for use with a pagoda of
the size above mentioned, should be not less than
twenty inches long by ten or twelve wide, and
fairly heavy, as being less liable to shift in use. It
must have an upright rim; through one corner of
which a minute hole is bored, countersunk and
polished on each side of the opening in order to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
diminish friction on a thread passing through it.</p>

<p>(3) An electric torch in the shape of a bottle;
the light showing itself at the mouth.</p>

<p>(4) A black dress-hook, sewn point upwards to
the lower edge of the performer’s vest on the right
or left side, as may best suit his own position in
working the trick, just where back and front meet.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/figure22.jpg" width="250" height="275" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 22</span></p>
</div>

<p>It will be found on examination of the pagoda
that each of the parts of which it consists has a hole
bored vertically through its centre. The topmost
portion has in addition a pinhole passing horizontally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
across it, about halfway down. Through this
a black pin, bent at the head, passes as shown in
Fig. 22. In preparation for the trick a piece about
three feet long of black <i>plaited</i> silk line, with a
small wire ring at one end, is passed by the aid of
a needle through the hole in the tray from the outer
side; thence upward through the various sections
of the pagoda, beginning with the undermost, till
it finally comes up through the head. After the
needle has been drawn off, the end of the thread is
formed into a loop, which is passed over the cross-pin
before mentioned. The thread is then drawn
taut from below, the several segments of the
pagoda resting fairly one upon another in the centre
of the tray. The intermediate portion of the
thread is drawn up till the little ring at the outer
end comes close to the tray, and is laid upon it in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
zigzag fashion so as prevent the possibility of
its fouling at a critical moment.</p>

<p>The introductory patter may run as follows:</p>

<p>“In the course of my travels in Central Africa&mdash;you
didn’t know that I had been in Central Africa?
Strange, how little the world knows of its greatest
men! But no matter! When I was in Africa I
chanced to come upon the place where the Golliwoggs
live.</p>

<p>“It’s a nice place&mdash;for those who like that sort
of place, but most people would find it a little too
warm. It is so warm there that the hens lay their
eggs hard-boiled, and you dig up potatoes ready
baked. It is too warm for anything but simple
life,&mdash;the very simple life, particularly as regards
clothing. The ordinary walking dress for a gentleman
Golliwogg is a pair of braces. The king
wears two pairs; except on state occasions, when
he wears one of those short shirts instead. You
know the kind I mean&mdash;all front. I think they
call them ‘dickeys.’</p>

<p>“The ladies are more dressy. They get the
fashions from back numbers of the <i>Daily Mail</i>;
kimonos and camisoles and corsets all in the latest
style. They are made with green paint and put
on with a shaving brush. There is only one thing
that bothers the court dressmakers. They can’t
make a crinoline.”</p>

<p>[If desired to shorten the patter the fashion
details may be omitted.]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>“I mention these little matters in order to give
you an idea of the place, in case any of you might
like to take a week-end trip there. If you are old
and tough, you might risk it. If you are young
and tender, you had better not.</p>

<p>“The special point of interest is a curious pagoda
in the centre of the village. It is seventy-five feet
high and is supposed to be the habitation of Mumbo
Jumbo; a sort of deputy devil, much respected in
those parts. This little model is an exact copy of
it. You can’t call it pretty, but there is a very
remarkable thing about it. When the king
dies (which happens by accident about once
a fortnight), the pagoda is pulled down, and if the
new king is acceptable to Mumbo Jumbo (which
depends upon the amount of his tip to the chief
witch doctor) old Mum rebuilds it himself by
magic. You don’t see him do it. The pagoda just
sits up and paws the air, so to speak. If Mumbo
does not approve, the proposed king gets a knock
on the head with a cocoa-nut, and some more liberal
Golliwogg is crowned instead.</p>

<p>“I naturally wanted to know how the miracle
was worked; and I managed to buy the secret from
one of the witch doctors. He sold it to me for a
pair of sixpenny-half penny sock suspenders. He
didn’t wear socks, but that didn’t matter. He put
the suspenders on at once and strutted about, as
proud as a dog with three tails.</p>

<p>“Now, I am going to tell you the secret. Scientists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
tell us that the sun throws out three sorts
of rays; light-rays, heat-rays, and force-rays.
The artful witch doctors have found out a way of
bottling off the force rays. They are mild at first,
but when they get old in the bottle, so to speak, they
become so strong that if you know how to do it you
can lift the heaviest weights with them.</p>

<p>“I managed to get hold of a small bottle of the
rays” (show bottle) “and I will show you, on a
very small scale, how the thing is done.</p>

<p>“First, we will take the pagoda to pieces.”</p>

<p>Standing behind the table, the performer moves
the pagoda to the corner of the tray nearest his
own left hand; so as to leave space for the different
portions when separated. He then picks up all the
parts save the base, holding them carefully
together, and drawing away with them a length
of the thread about equal to the diagonal of the
tray. Passing the undermost section downwards
along the thread, he lays it down beside the base,
afterwards treating the other portions in the same
way, the several portions finally resting on the tray
somewhat as shown in Fig. 23.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/figure23.jpg" width="400" height="150" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 23</span></p>
</div>

<p>If the length of the thread has been properly
gauged (this is a matter to be determined by
experiment beforehand), there should be some
twelve or fourteen inches of “slack.” Slipping
the ring at the end over the little hook before
mentioned, the performer moves a little away
from the table, so as to draw this portion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
of the thread all but taut, between his own body
and the tray.</p>

<p>“And now to utilise our force rays.” Holding
up the bottle-shaped torch in his right hand, he
turns its light onto the tray, at the same time edging
away farther from the table and moving about
behind it so as to cause a gradual pull upon the
thread; the effect being that the severed parts of
the pagoda mount gradually one upon another in
due order. It is probable that they will not rest
exactly one upon the other. In any case the performer
affects to notice that they do not. Making
a remark to that effect he steps close to the table
to straighten them up, and under cover of so doing
draws with the finger nail the pin in the uppermost
portion, thereby releasing the thread. Stepping
back again, as though the better to judge whether
the pagoda is now “plumb,” he thereby draws<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
away the line, and detaching the ring from the
hook, lets it fall to the ground. This done, he
returns to the table, and shifting the restored
pagoda to the centre of the tray, brings all forward,
inviting anyone who cares to do so, to satisfy
himself that there has been “no deception.”</p>

<h3>THE STORY OF THE ALKAHEST</h3>

<p>The requirements for this trick are as follows:</p>

<p>(1) Two wands, exactly alike in appearance.
One of them to be that just used in some previous
trick or tricks (which we will call No. 2), and the
other, prepared as to be presently explained, to
be secretly substituted for it immediately before
the presentation of the present trick. This can be
easily done by the aid of a couple of pairs of cup-hooks
fixed behind the table or a chair after the
manner described in “Later Magic,” p. 126; or
the wands may be exchanged during journey to
the table at an early stage of the trick; by means
of a pocket of suitable shape within the left breast
of the coat. This is a matter as to which the performer
will please himself, but the exhibition in
the first instance of an obviously unprepared wand
is essential to the artistic finish of the trick.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>(2) Two pieces of ribbon, three-quarters to one
inch wide, alike in colour. Of these, one piece is
to be wound round the end of wand No. 2 at about
three inches from the end, and secured by a rubber
ring, of the solid kind used for holding together
the ribs of an umbrella. This wand, after being
“switched” for the unprepared one, must be so
placed upon the table that the end on which the
ribbon is wound shall be masked from view by the
second piece of ribbon, lying in a loose heap in
front of it.</p>

<p>(3) A stoppered bottle of clear glass, preferably
of some ornamental or quaint design. This bears
a label, of discoloured and time-worn appearance,
with the letter <i>H R</i> written on it in crabbed but
distinct characters, and is about half-filled with
<i>Eau de Cologne</i> or lavender water, to which a few
grains of cochineal have been added, giving it a
rich ruby colour. So far as the working of the
trick is concerned plain water might be used, but a
coloured and scented liquid is preferable for the
sake of effect.</p>

<p>(4) A spare rubber ring, of the kind above
described, placed in left-hand vest-pocket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>The trick may be introduced as follows:</p>

<p>“For the next surprise I have to show you we
are indebted to the ancient alchemists. People
regard them as back numbers nowadays, because
they didn’t know anything about aeroplanes, or
appendicitis, or income tax and such-like up-to-date
luxuries; but they had a good many useful
little secrets of their own. One of them was the
recipe for what was called the Alkahest, a liquid
which immediately dissolved anything it touched;
from a gold watch to a set of fire-irons. The secret
of making it has long been lost, and all that still
exists of the liquid itself I have here in this
bottle.”</p>

<p>The bottle is here brought forward and offered
for inspection.</p>

<p>“Pretty colour, isn’t it? And it has a very
delightful perfume.” (Takes out stopper.)
“You are welcome to smell it but I don’t advise
you to taste it. If you did you would probably
never taste anything again. I want you to notice,
by the way, those two letters <i>H R</i> on the label.
There is a dead secret attached to those letters.
They mean something, of course; but nobody
knows what it is.”</p>

<p>The bottle is replaced on the table.</p>

<p>“This bottle came into my hands by inheritance.
An ancestor of mine, in the reign of James the
First, was an alchemist in a small way. He is
reputed to have made a handsome income by selling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
ladies something to put in their husbands’ tea.
History doesn’t say what. Let us hope it was only
sugar. Well, this old gentleman managed to get
hold of the recipe for making the Alkahest.
Whether he found it out himself, or whether he
cribbed it from the cookery-book of some other
alchemist, I can’t say. Anyhow, he got it; and
he made up some of the stuff and put it in that
bottle.</p>

<p>“When he was just going to be burnt as a wizard,
which was the regular thing with scientific
men in those days, he handed the bottle to his eldest
son, my great-great-grandfather seventeen
times removed, saying, ‘Take it, my son, and may
it do you more good than it has done me.’</p>

<p>“My great-great-grandfather took the bottle;
but he had no idea what it contained. He was just
going to ask his father what the letters on it meant,
but just at that moment the old gentleman flared
up, and it was too late. For the rest of his life my
great-great-grandfather puzzled his head as to
what those two letters <i>H R</i> stood for, but all he
could think of was ‘horse-radish,’ and he knew
it couldn’t be that.</p>

<p>“Since that the bottle has been handed down in
our family for sixteen generations, till at last it
came to the hands of my Uncle James, and he puzzled
over those letters like the rest. Uncle James
was a bit of a ‘nut,’ and prided himself on his fine
head of hair, but in course of time he found he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
getting a bit thin on the top, and it worried him.
One day, thinking over the mysterious letters, an
idea struck him. ‘H R!’ he exclaimed, ‘H R!
why “Hair Restorer” of course, not a doubt of it!
I’ll try it this very night.’ He did. He rubbed
it in, and went to sleep quite happy, but when he
tried to brush his hair in the morning there wasn’t
any left to brush. The Alkahest had taken it all
off, and left him as bald as a baby.</p>

<p>“He went to bed again, and ordered a wig, but
before it could be sent home he caught such a
cold in his head that he died. Just-sneezed-himself-away.”</p>

<p>(The last words to be spoken slowly and sadly.)</p>

<p>“I notice that some of you ladies are weeping.
It <i>is</i> an affecting story, no doubt, and I used to
shed a tear over it myself. But after all, you
didn’t know my Uncle James. Neither did I, for
the matter of that, and if we had known him we
might not have liked him. So we won’t stop to
grieve about him.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>“One of the most striking experiments with the
Alkahest is the dissolving of a paving stone, particularly
if you lay a bunch of violets on it and
dissolve them both together, when you get a scuttleful
of best Violet Powder. Unfortunately I
haven’t a paving stone handy, and I don’t suppose
any gentleman present is likely to have one about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
him. No? I feared not! Another pretty experiment
is the dissolving of a diamond ring,
but I have no diamond rings myself, and I find
that if I borrow other people’s and don’t return
them I get myself disliked. So I must try to show
the power of the Alkahest in a less expensive way.”</p>

<p>Returning to his table, the performer with his
right hand picks up the prepared wand (holding
it so as to conceal the ribbon coiled upon it), and
with the left hand the mass of loose ribbon.</p>

<p>“I have here a piece of ribbon: just ordinary
ribbon. Will some lady oblige me by tying a knot
in it, about three inches from the end. Thank you!
Now will some other lady tie another knot about
three inches from the first one.”</p>

<p>This is repeated till five or six knots have been
tied, taking up about half the ribbon.</p>

<p>“I am not sure how many knots have been tied.
Please count them for me as I roll the ribbon round
my wand.”</p>

<p>So saying, he winds the ribbon, beginning with
the knotted end, on to the free portion of the wand,
counting the knots as he does so, and continuing
the winding till the whole has been taken up. In
so doing he takes care to cover up the knots, and
to make the appearance of the rolled ribbon correspond
as nearly as possible with the hidden coil
upon the other end, finally securing it with the rubber
ring from his pocket.</p>

<p>We will suppose that five knots are found to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
have been tied. The performer returns to the
table to fetch the bottle; and during the transit
passes the wand to the opposite hand, in so doing
drawing off the knotted ribbon (to be dropped a
moment later into the profonde), and exposes the
opposite end. He removes stopper from bottle,
leaving it on the table.</p>

<p>“Now comes the most critical part of the operation.
I am going by means of the Alkahest to
dissolve these knots. How many did we say there
were? Five? Then I must use five drops and
no more. If I were to overdo it in the smallest
degree the consequences would be serious. I
should destroy the ribbon altogether, and in these
hard times ribbon is ribbon, even if it is only six-three
a yard.”</p>

<p>He brings forward the bottle, and with great
pretence of accuracy lets fall on the ribbon the
suggested number of drops. Then slipping off the
rubber ring he offers the end of the ribbon to some
member of the company to unwind, when the knots

The prepared article lies just within the forward rim of an oblong
Japanese tray, and at a convenient moment the unprepared wand just
used is laid behind and parallel with it. A little later this is professedly
picked up again, but as a matter of fact is pushed forward by
the tips of the fingers, and takes the place of the prepared wand, which
is picked up in its stead.</p>

<h3>THE ORACLE OF MEMPHIS</h3>

<p>This is of the nature of a magical toy rather
than a conjuring trick proper, but its exhibition
may form a pleasant interlude in the course of a
social entertainment. I invented it at an early
stage of my magical career, and exhibited it on
various occasions for the amusement of friends,
but made no further use of it. The apparatus has
been put aside, and has been out of sight, out of
mind, for many years past. Coming across it accidentally
some short time ago, I was agreeably surprised
to find that it would still answer questions
as promptly, and doubtless as truthfully, as of
yore.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>The general appearance of the apparatus, which
is eight inches high by seven in outside diameter,
is as depicted in Fig. 24. It consists of a circular
mahogany stand or base, resting on three small
feet, and surmounted by a glass dome <i>b</i>. This last
is in fact a bell-glass, as used by gardeners, and
has at top the usual knob, whereby to lift it. To
this is attached a short loop of narrow ribbon.
The glass dome does not rest directly on the stand,
its lower edge being encased in a mahogany mount.
From the centre of the stand rises a vertical pin,
a quarter of an inch in height, serving as pivot for
a metal pointer (Fig. 25), which, by means of a
little cup, or socket, at its centre, can be lifted on
and off, and revolves freely upon it, after the manner
of a compass. A further item of the apparatus
is a reversible cardboard dial, whose two sides,
front and back, are depicted in Figs. 26 and 27. It
will be seen that the circumference of this dial is
divided on the one side (Fig. 26) into four equal
sections, each bearing a pip of one of the four suits.
The other side (Fig. 27) is divided into eight sections,
marked with the numerals, from seven to ten
inclusive, and the letters A, K, Q, and J, answering
to Ace, King, Queen and Jack.</p>

<p>With the Oracle is used a set of eight questions,
and a piquet pack of cards, on the backs of which
are written or printed thirty-two answers appropriate
to such questions, one of each suit to each
question. The person consulting the Oracle having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
selected the question he or she desires to have
answered, the dial is laid on the stand with the
“suit” or Fig. 26 side uppermost, and the pointer
is placed in position on its pivot. The querist is
invited to breathe into the glass, which is then
lowered on to the stand. The pointer begins to
move, and after a moment or two of indecision,
comes to rest opposite one or other of the four suit-pips;
we will suppose, for the sake of illustration,
the diamond. The glass is then lifted off, the dial
reversed, the pointer replaced, and the glass once
more lowered on to the stand. Again the pointer
moves, and stops this time, we will say, at the number
“seven.” The seven of diamonds is sought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
for in the pack, and is found to bear a more or less
appropriate answer to the question asked.</p>

<p>The movements of the pointer are governed by
the fact that, imbedded in the mahogany mount
surrounding the base of the bell glass, is a piece
of thick steel wire, strongly magnetised, and
extending half way round the circle. The pointer,
though so coloured as to have the appearance of
brass, is in reality a magnetic steel needle, and
therefore when resting on the pivot and covered
by the glass, will automatically move round till
it comes to rest between the two magnetic poles
formed to the opposite ends of the hidden wire.
The operator can therefore, by placing the glass
cover accordingly, cause the indicator to stop at
any part of the dial that he pleases.</p>

<p>It remains to be explained what guides him in
the manipulation of the glass, so as to cause the
needle to stop at the point he desires. It will be
remembered that, attached to the knob at the top
of the glass, is a loop of ribbon, serving to suspend
the glass in use from the forefinger, as shown in
Fig. 28. But the loop has in truth a much more
important function than this. Before the loop is
formed, the ribbon is tied tightly round the neck
of the knob, previously waxed to prevent its slipping
round, and the knot is so placed that it shall
exactly correspond with that pole of the magnet
to which the point of the needle is intended to be
in use attracted. This done, a loop is formed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
the two ends of the ribbon, and so arranged in
point of length that when the glass is suspended
from the forefinger, as in the diagram, the thumb
and second finger of the operator shall be just right
for moving it round in either direction, the little
knot guiding him by feel to bring it to the desired
point.</p>

<p>The exhibitor is not limited to any particular
set of questions and answers. At the cost of a
fresh pack of cards and a little ingenuity, he can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
please himself in this particular. The selection of
suitable questions and answers is however a somewhat
delicate matter. The answers must on the
one hand be smart enough to afford amusement
to the company generally; and on the other hand
must not be so pungent as to be likely to cause
offence to a person putting the question.</p>

<p>The questions and answers I devised for my own
use ran somewhat as follows:</p>

<p>It will be found on comparing them that the
answers are arranged on a regular system, those on
the red cards being of a more or less complimentary
nature, or otherwise favourable; the black
suits less so, particularly the clubs, which are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
rather the reverse, and are intended to be used as
replies to gentlemen only. Bearing this arrangement
in mind, it is a comparatively easy matter to
suit the answer to the querist.</p>

<p>The questions must be memorised in proper
order, and it is desirable to do the same with the
answers also, though there should be no difficulty,
remembering the principle of arrangement, in giving
a fairly appropriate answer, even though the
memory be for the moment at fault as to its exact
terms. To avoid the necessity of giving the same
answer more than once, it is well to make a rule
that the same question shall not be asked more than
three times.</p>

<p>The Oracle may be introduced as follows:</p>

<p>“Allow me to introduce to your notice a curio of
an exceptionally interesting kind. This elegant
little affair is said to have been the private Oracle
of Rameses the Second, a gentleman who flourished
in Egypt about four thousand years ago. I can’t
be sure to a year or two, because it was before my
time, but I believe that is about right. People
sometimes express surprise that, being so ancient,
the Oracle should be in such good condition, but
that is accounted for by its having been preserved
in the same case as Rammy’s mummy. I don’t
mean his mamma, but the gentleman himself, in
the cold storage of the period. The story may or
may not be true. I can’t take any responsibility
for it. Others declare that the Oracle was the favourite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
plaything of Helen of Troy. Historians do
tell such tarradiddles that one doesn’t know what
to believe.</p>

<p>“The powers of the Oracle are limited, for it will
only answer eight questions, and in its own way,
but its answers are quite trustworthy&mdash;well, perhaps
not <i>quite</i>. Let us say as trustworthy as those
of Bond Street fortune-tellers at a guinea a guess.
Who will be the first to test its veracity?</p>

<p>“I should mention, by the way, that, as each
answer exhausts a certain amount of power, the
same question must not be asked more than three
times. You would like to consult the Oracle,
Madam? Then please select one of the questions
on this card, and read it out for the information of
the Company.</p>

<p>“You wish to know” (repeating question).
“Good. The answer to your question will be found
on one or other of the cards in this pack, and the
Oracle will tell us which one to look for. First,
however, I must ask you to breathe into this glass.
That supplies the missing link, so to speak, and
makes it a sort of personal affair between you and
the Oracle.” (This is done.)</p>

<p>“Thank you. Now I shall place the glass on its
stand, and this little pointer” (holding it up and
placing it on its pivot) “will reveal the correct
answer, first indicating the suit among which the
answer is to be found. You may notice that it
wobbles a bit at first. That is because it is thinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
over the question. Now it has come to rest,
and it says the answer will be found in the”&mdash;(name
suit.) “And now to find out which is the
right card of that suit. I take off the glass and
turn the dial over. Please concentrate your mind
on your question. I put the glass and the pointer
on again. Again the pointer thinks it over, and
finally decides as you see, for the&mdash;” (naming
number of card.) “Now all we have to do is to
look out that card” (does so) “and here we have
the answer to your question.”</p>

<p>Before inviting a fresh querist to breathe into
the glass, it is well to wipe it out carefully with a
silk pocket handkerchief, professedly to dispel the
personal magnetism of the last enquirer, any
remains of which, left within the glass, might
imperil the correctness of the anticipated answer.</p>

<h3>THE MYSTERY OF MAHOMET<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></h3>

<p>The reader is probably familiar with the trick
known as “The Silver Tube and Ball.” If not,
it may be stated that the “tube” is of metal, nickelled,
and about eight inches long by one and a
half in diameter. With it is used an ebony ball,
which is made to pass into and out of the tube in a
very surprising way.</p>

<p>The secret lies partly in the fact that half way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
down, the internal diameter of the tube is very
slightly narrowed, forming a sort of “choke,” so
that a ball dropped into it at the upper end does
not fall right through, as one would naturally
expect, but stops at that point, wedging itself
lightly, so that the tube can be reversed without
any fear of the ball falling out, though it can be
instantly driven out by bringing down the tube
smartly on the table, or by very slight pressure
behind it.</p>

<p>The other part of the secret lies in the fact that
<i>two</i> balls are in reality used, the existence of the
second being of course unknown to the spectator.
The tube being loaded as above mentioned, <i>i.e.</i> having
the one ball wedged in it just below the choke,
if the duplicate is dropped in from above it will
apparently fall through, though as a matter of fact
this ball comes to a standstill in the tube above the
choke, while the other is driven out at the bottom.
The secret use of this second ball enables the performer
to produce sundry surprising results in the
way of appearances and disappearances.</p>

<p>The possibilities of the trick in this form are
however speedily exhausted, and it has a serious
drawback in the fact that it is necessary to invert
the tube afresh before each production, as it is
obvious that a ball contained in it must be brought
below the choke before it can be produced. I had
at one time rather a fancy for the trick, but it
seemed to me that it was capable of a good deal of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
improvement, and after some cogitation I succeeded
in producing a new trick on somewhat similar
lines; but free from the defect mentioned above
and capable withal of producing a far wider variety
of effects.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 175px;">
<img src="images/figure29.jpg" width="175" height="250" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 29</span></p>
</div>

<p>I use two tubes of stiff cardboard, each about
four inches long by one and a half in diameter.
One of these is just a plain tube with no speciality
about it. The other has a piece of fine wire crossing
it midway from side to side, and taking the
form of a half hoop, as shown in Fig. 29, the ends
serving as pivots on which it moves freely. On the
outside, one of its ends is turned down vertically,
forming a tiny switch or handle. The normal
tendency of the halfhoop is to hang downward
across the tube (thereby closing it to the passage of
a ball) but a touch of the finger, moving the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
switch to right or left, raises the loop to a horizontal
position against one or other of the sides
of the tube, when it no longer offers any obstacle
to the passing of the ball. The wire used is so thin
that with the halfhoop lying against its side a spectator
may safely be allowed to look through the
tube even at a very short distance, without fear of
his perceiving the presence of the wire.</p>

<p>The requirements for the trick, all told, are as
follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>(1) The wand.</li>
<li>(2) The plain tube.</li>
<li>(3) The trick tube.</li>
<li>(4) Two white balls.</li>
<li>(5) A red ball.</li>
<li>(6) A lighted candle.</li>
<li>(7) A small red silk handkerchief.</li>
</ul>

<p>One of the white balls must be vested or otherwise
so placed as to be ready for production from
the wand. The second white ball and the red ball
are stowed in the pochettes, one on each side. The
faked tube may be vested and exchanged for the
plain one during the journey back to the table
after the dummy has been tendered for inspection;
the latter being dropped into the profonde.
These however are matters which the expert will
arrange after his own fashion. If the performer,
not being an expert, doubts his ability to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
“change” the tubes neatly during the transit, he
may suppress the plain tube altogether and commence
at once with the exhibition of the faked tube
from the platform, but the omission makes the
trick less convincing.</p>

<p>We will suppose that the performer goes for
the maximum effect and advances offering the
dummy tube for inspection. The patter I suggest
for the trick in this form runs as follows:</p>

<p>“I have here, ladies and gentlemen, a hollow tube.
It is not uncommon for tubes to be hollow, but this
one is, if anything, even hollower than usual. I
should like some lady or gentleman to examine it
carefully and testify that it is just a plain ordinary
tube with absolutely no deception of any sort about
it. If it was not so, you may be sure I should
hardly venture to let you examine it. You can see
through it, hear through it, or blow through it.
You are satisfied? Then I will show you a curious
little experiment with it.”</p>

<p>During the return to the table the dummy is
exchanged for the trick tube.</p>

<p>“I call the experiment I am about to show you
‘The Mystery of Mahomet.’ I gave it that name
because it was Mahomet who suggested the idea to
me. I don’t mean personally. I didn’t know
him. In point of fact he did not give me the idea
till after he had been dead for some years. This
sounds peculiar, but I will explain.</p>

<p>“When Mahomet died he wasn’t buried like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
other people. His coffin was placed in a mosque,
where it hangs in the air like a captive balloon,
about twenty feet up, resting on nothing at all. I
am not certain as to the exact height from the
ground, but that is what the Moslems say, and they
would hardly tell a story about a little thing like
that. It has always been a mystery what keeps
the prophet up aloft. Some say it is done by mesmerism,
some say by magnetism, and one old gentleman
declared it was done by mormonism. No
doubt, when you come to think of it Mahomet was
a bit of a Mormon. But they are all wide of the
mark. As a matter of fact the coffin rests on a
slab of compressed air. It’s quite simple, when
you know it. I haven’t a coffin handy, but by
means of this little tube I can show you the effect
of the same principle on a smaller scale.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>“As some of you have not had the opportunity
of personally examining the tube I should like to
prove to you in the first place that it is really what
it appears to be, a simple cardboard cylinder, open
from end to end, and as free from deception as I
am myself.</p>

lie against the side of the tube.)</p>

</div>

<p>“I have here a little ball, of such a size that it
passes easily through the tube.”<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> The ball is
allowed to fall through, from the one hand to the
other.</p>

<p>“Now I will place the tube upright on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
table and drop the ball in once more. Where is it
now? On the table, you say. Quite right: here
it is.” (Lift tube, closing it, and placing it on
end beside ball.) “But now I take a few handfuls
of air and press them well down into the tube”
(makes believe to do so), “and I drop the ball in
again. This time you see it does not fall through.
As a matter of fact it has stopped halfway, resting
on the compressed air in the tube.” (Lift tube,
showing that the ball has not passed through.
After replacing the tube switch the wire loop to
the horizontal position, allowing the ball to drop
inside the tube.) “I think there can be no doubt
that this is the way Mr. Home, the medium, managed
to float about with his head in the air and his
feet on the mantelpiece. All that was needed was
a few pints of compressed air in his tail-pockets.
It’s quite simple, when you know how it’s done.</p>

<p>“Of course, as the tube is open at the top, the
effect doesn’t last very long. The compressed air
gradually expands again and becomes too thin to
support the ball any longer. I dare say by this
time it has done so.” (Lift tube, exposing ball,
and re-closing tube). “Yes, here it is.”</p>

<p>“I can keep the air from escaping to a certain
extent, because I happen to have a very strong
won’t. A strong will is a good thing to have, but
sometimes a strong won’t is even more useful.
Once again I will fill the tube with compressed air.”
(Make believe to do so, then pick up the closed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
tube.) “I drop the ball in again, and this time it
will remain suspended till I permit the compressed
air to escape.” (Pick up tube, holding it vertically
a few inches above the table.) “Say when you
would like the ball to fall. Now? Good! I withdraw
my strong won’t and the ball falls at once.”
(Switch loop, allowing it to do so, then pass tube,
closing it, to opposite hand and load into it duplicate
ball at top; then replacing tube on table.)</p>

<p>“Now, by way of variety, we will try compressing
the ball instead of the air.” (Pick up ball left
on table and make believe to transfer it to the opposite
hand. Then, with the left hand empty, make
pretence of crushing it into the hand.) “The ball
is now resolved into its component atoms. You
didn’t see them go? No, of course you didn’t.
For the time being they are dematerialised: but the
compressed air in the tube will soon solidify them
again.” (Lift tube, keeping ball suspended.)
“It has not got solid yet, but we shall not have long
to wait.” (After a few moments again lift tube,
opening it and allowing ball to pass through.)
“Here is the ball, now as solid as before.”</p>

<p>Transfer tube closed to opposite hand and in so
doing load in red ball at top. In replacing tube
on table open and close it again, so that the ball
shall fall, but shall rest within the tube on the
table.</p>

<p>“Now I will show you another curious effect. A
ball which has been dematerialised in that way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
becomes very sensitive to colour. I will just give
the ball a rub with this red silk handkerchief and
drop it into the tube again.” Drop in white ball
after rubbing, keeping tube closed; then raise it
and show red ball at bottom.</p>

<p>“Here it is again, you see, but it has taken the
colour of the handkerchief and is now a rosy red,
a sort of maiden’s blush; the blush of a very shy
maiden. Unfortunately maiden’s blush is not a
fast colour, unless it’s the wrong kind; the kind
that’s rubbed in with a powder puff. This kind
soon gets pale again. I rub the ball again, this
time with a white handkerchief, and again drop
it into the tube.”</p>

<p>Drop in red ball, tube closed, lift and show white
ball, under cover of its appearance transferring
tube to opposite hand and allowing red ball to
run back into palm to be got rid of a moment
later.</p>

<p>“I think I heard a lady say, ‘Where is the red
ball?’ This is the red ball, at least it was the red
ball a moment ago. There is no other, for, as you
see, the tube is empty.”</p>

<p>Again drop tube over candle as in Fig. 30. Pass
ball from hand to hand and finally make believe to
swallow it, meanwhile dropping it into the profonde.</p>

<p>“After being treated like this the ball becomes so
volatile that I used to be always losing it. But I
never lose it now. I just swallow it and then I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
know just where it is when I want it. It saves a
lot of trouble.”</p>

<h3>THE BEWILDERING BLOCKS</h3>

<p>The blocks which give its title to this trick are
inch-square wooden cubes, three in number, as
illustrated in Fig. 32. Each is coloured black on
two of its opposite sides; these in use being made
top and bottom. The four remaining sides are in
the case of one block red, of another white, and of
a third blue. The only other item of apparatus
known to the spectators is a square cardboard tube,
as depicted in Fig. 33. This is about five inches
long, and of such dimensions laterally as to let
either block slide by its own weight easily through
it, but no more. All four items may be freely submitted
to inspection, for in this case appearances
are not deceitful. Both the blocks and the tube are
no more and no less than they seem to be.</p>

<p>In exhibiting the trick, the tube is placed upright
on the table, and the three blocks are dropped into
it one after another, the company being requested
to note particularly the order in which they are
inserted, which we will suppose to be in the first
instance blue, then white, and lastly red, as shown
without the tube in Fig. 32. It is clear that, once
inserted, they cannot by any natural means alter
their relative positions, but, strange to say, when
they are again uncovered, the red block just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
inserted at the top is found to have passed to the
bottom, the other two moving up accordingly.</p>

<p>This surprising effect is produced by the secret
introduction into the tube of a fourth block of
which the spectators know nothing. This, which
we will call the “trick” block, is, like the rest, coloured
black at the top and bottom; but of the
remaining four sides two, contiguous to each other,
are red, and the other two blue.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/figure32-34.jpg" width="400" height="275" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 32</span> <span class="smcap spacer">Fig. 33</span> <span class="smcap">Fig. 34</span></p>
</div>

<p>When the tube is handed back to the performer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
after inspection, before placing it on the table he
secretly introduces the trick block into its lower
end, privately noting against which sides of the
tube the two <i>red</i> faces will lie, and taking care in
placing the tube upon the table that the angle
formed by these two sides shall be to the front.
The other three blocks are then, in accordance with
the patter, dropped in from above, in the order
shown in Fig. 32, resting, unknown to the spectators,
on top of the trick block. When the performer
lifts off the tube, which he does grasping it diagonally
between thumb and finger at about an inch
from the top, he does so with gentle pressure,
thereby holding back the uppermost block within
the tube, and exposing the two others with the trick
block at the bottom, as indicated by Fig. 34.</p>

<p>I gave a description of this trick in the <i>Magician</i>
of February, 1914. The patter for its exhibition
was based on a popular nursery legend, and as this
mode of presentation won general approval from
the juveniles I cannot do better than repeat it practically
as there given. The needful working
instructions will be found interspersed with the
patter.</p>

<p>“What I am going to show you now is not a trick,
or, if you can call it a trick, it is one that works
itself, for you will see for yourselves that I have
really nothing to do with it. It is just an illustration
of the force of bad example.</p>

<p>“No doubt you have all heard of a young gentleman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
called Fidgety Phil. There is a little poem
about him. It says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘Fidgety Phil</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Couldn’t keep still,</div>
<div class="verse">Made his mother and father ill.’</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“There are a lot more verses but I am sorry to
say I don’t know them. However, these few lines
are enough to show you what sort of a boy Fidgety
Phil was. He was the kind of boy that wherever
he is, he wants to be somewhere else. When he
was standing up he wanted to sit down, and when
he was sitting down he wriggled about on his chair
till he was allowed to stand up again.</p>

<p>“These little blocks are all that are left of a
box of bricks which are said to have belonged to
Fidgety Phil and they show what even a box of
bricks may come to if a bad example is constantly
set before them. These three little bricks have got
to be just as fidgety as Phil was himself. Anyhow,
that is the only way in which I can account
for their queer behaviour.</p>

<p>“Please have a good look at them, and see if you
can discover anything peculiar about them. I
can’t, myself.” (The blocks are handed for examination.)
“They seem to me to be just ordinary
bits of coloured wood, and this square tube is
believed to have been a chimney pot belonging to
the same set. I want you to notice particularly
that the bricks are just the right size to fit closely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
in the chimney. They go in quite easily; but when
they are once inside they can’t turn round, or turn
over, or change places. But the curious thing is
that though they can’t they <i>do</i>, as you will see
presently.</p>

<p>“I place the chimney-pot here on the table,
where you can see all round it, and I drop the
three bricks into it one by one. Notice particularly
the order in which I put them in. First, the
blue. You heard it go down. Next, the white,
and now, the red. Don’t forget. Blue at the bottom,
white in the middle, and red at the top.</p>

<p>“Now, without my saying or doing anything,
they will at once begin to shift about. They can’t
keep still for more than a few seconds. When I
lift off the chimney pot, you will find that they have
changed places.” (It is lifted accordingly, performer
holding back the uppermost block within it
by gentle pressure on opposite angles of the tube,
and exhibiting only the three lower blocks now as
in Fig. 34.)</p>

<p>“There, as I told you, like Fidgety Phil, they
couldn’t keep still. The white brick has climbed
to the top, the red one has gone down to the bottom,
and the blue one is now in the middle.</p>

<p>“We will try again. I will put the bricks in in
just the same order, to make it easier for you to
remember them.”</p>

<p>Performer has meanwhile allowed the red block,
left in the upper part of the tube, to sink to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
bottom, checked by the third finger, and replaces
tube upright on table.</p>

<p>“As before, I drop in first the blue, then the
white, then the red.” (This last being the trick
block, care must be taken to keep its <i>red</i> sides well
to the front.)</p>

<p>“Again I lift off the chimney pot, and again
you see, the bricks have changed places. White
has come to the top, and red has gone to the bottom
again.”</p>

<p>The trick block, which this time remained at
the top, is now allowed to slide down to the bottom.
The tube is again placed on the table, but so turned
that the <i>blue</i> sides of the block within it are brought
to the front.</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you why the bricks behave in this
way, but you can see for yourselves that <i>I</i> have
nothing to do with it. We will try it once more,
and for a change I will put the red block in first,
then the white and then the blue. That order will
be easy to remember. Red, white and blue reckoning
from the bottom upwards. Again I remove the
cover. The same thing has happened again, but
with a little difference. White has come to the
top again, but blue has this time gone to the bottom.”</p>

<p>While attention is drawn to the new order of
the blocks, the performer allows the ordinary blue
one, now left in the tube, to slide out into his hand,
and in picking up the others secretly substitutes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
this for the trick block, which is now at the bottom
of the tube.</p>

<p>“Once more, ladies and gentlemen, here is the
chimney pot, and here are the three bricks, for
inspection by any one who cares to look at them.
Perhaps some of you may be able to account for
their remarkable behaviour. It’s a puzzle to me;
but I never was good at guessing. My own idea is
that they are haunted by the ghost of Fidgety
Phil. If not, I give it up.”</p>

<h3>AN “OD” FORCE</h3>

<p>To avoid misconception, it may be well to state
at once that the peculiar spelling of the word “od”
in the above title is not a printer’s error. The
explanation will be found in the patter, which is
founded on a discovery claimed to have been made
by a scientist at one time of world-wide renown,
and the responsibility for so spelling the word rests
with him. For programme purposes the reader
is at liberty to re-name the trick according to his
own fancy. “Mysterious Motion,” or “Moved by
Magic” would fairly represent the effect produced,
which consists in causing a borrowed coin to move
automatically at the will of the operator, in various
directions.</p>

<p>The requirements for the trick are as follows:</p>

<p>(1) The “tramway” whereon the coin is to be
made to travel. This consists of a slab of wood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
thirteen inches long by four wide, and three-eighths
of an inch thick and covered as to its upper
side with fine black cloth. To the cloth-covered
side of this is attached, by means of a screw at
each corner, a parallelogram of brass or copper
wire enclosing a space two inches wide. The four
screws, which are likewise of brass, and which are
of the round-headed kind, are within the parallelogram
and serve to keep the wire extended. Midway
at each end is another screw, driven in <i>outside</i>
the wire, in such manner as to make all taut.
These last two screws, for a reason connected with
the working of the trick, stand up a shade higher
than the other four, but the difference is not great
enough to be noticeable. See Fig. 35.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/figure35.jpg" width="400" height="225" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 35</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>(2) A special “pull” carried on the person of
the performer. This consists of a fine black
thread, to one end of which is attached a weight
travelling up and down the trouser leg, after the
manner described (in connection with a self-suspending
wand) at page 111 of “Later Magic.” In
the present case, however, the weight is much
smaller, being in fact just large enough to rather
more than counterbalance the coin used in the
trick, <i>plus</i> the friction to be overcome by the thread
in the working of the trick. The degree of such
friction is an uncertain quantity, as it will largely
depend on the nature of the operator’s underwear
and its closeness to his own body. The precise
weight most effective must be ascertained by previous
experiment, and regulated accordingly.</p>

<p>It will be found convenient to use by way of
weight a glass tube, closed at the bottom like a
test-tube and loaded with buckshot, more or less
in quantity according to the weight required.
The mouth of the tube is closed by a cork, through
which one end of the thread is passed, and secured
on the under side by a knot and a spot of gum.
When the minimum weight that will effectually
serve the desired purpose has been ascertained, any
vacant space above the leaden pellets should be
filled with cotton wool (to prevent rattling) and the
cork should then be cemented into the tube. If
preferred, the wool may be interspersed among the
buckshot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>The opposite end of the thread, which will be
somewhere about thirty inches in length (this again
being a point to be determined by experiment),
is passed through the curled end of a good-sized
safety pin. This, for use in the trick, is attached
to the inside of the performer’s vest, just within
the lowest part of the opening. To the free-end
of the thread, after passing through the loop of
the pin, is attached a disc of copper or zinc, three-quarters
of an inch in diameter, against which, on
one side, is pressed and flattened out a pellet of
conjurer’s wax, in good adhesive condition. If the
length of the thread has been duly regulated, the
little disc will rest normally just within the vest,
but can be drawn out the extent of a couple of feet
or so, returning swiftly to its hiding place the
moment it is released.</p>

<p>(3) A glass ball&mdash;professedly crystal.</p>

<p>(4) An ordinary match-box, empty.</p>

<p>Instructions for the working of the trick will
be most conveniently given step by step with the
patter, which may run as follows:</p>

<p>“In the early days of Queen Victoria’s reign,
when the oldest of us here present were good little
boys or girls, and the rest were not born or thought
of, there lived a celebrated scientific gentleman,
called the Baron von Reichenbach. I am sorry to
say he was a German, but he couldn’t help it. As
his father and mother were Germans, he had to be
one too. It shows how careful children ought to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
in the choice of their parents. He invented a lot of
useful things, among them creosote and paraffin.
Neither of them smells very nice, but they don’t
trouble about that in Germany.</p>

<p>“Besides being a great chemist, Von Thingany
dabbled in what are called the occult sciences, and
he claimed to have discovered a new force (a sort
of magnetism, only different) and which, he
declared, pervaded every thing in nature, especially
crystal. Directed by a strong will, like his
own, or mine, it would do all sorts of wonderful
things. It seemed to me that such a force would
come in very handy for magical purposes, and I
set to work to invent it over again, and I have at
any rate produced something very like it. The
Baron called his force ‘odd,’ but he spelt it ‘od,’
which is odd too. You must judge for yourselves
whether my force is the same as his, and you can
spell it which way you like.</p>

<p>“I have only been able so far to work up a very
small amount of the force, say about six mouse-power,
so it won’t turn tables, or lift pianos. I can
only get it, so far, to move a small weight like a
florin or a half-dollar, and that only for a very short
distance. For greater conveniences I have made
this little tramway for the coin to perform upon.
These wires which you see are not for it to travel
on, but merely to get more equal distribution of
the force. There is nothing out of the way about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
it, nor with this ball, except that it is crystal.
Examine both as much as you please.”</p>

<p>The two articles are accordingly offered for
inspection. The performer takes back the tramway
in the left hand, holding it by one end in such
manner that it is gripped in the fork of the thumb,
leaving the thumb itself comparatively free. Taking
back the ball with the right hand and remarking
“Now to develop the force,” he rubs it on his
left coat-sleeve, and strokes the surface of the tramway
two or three times with it.</p>

<p>“Having now established a proper degree of
‘oddity’ between the tram and the crystal, I will
ask for the loan of a half-dollar (or florin as the
case may be) marked in any way the owner
pleases.”</p>

<p>He replaces the ball on the table, and in the act
of again turning to the audience gets hold of the
waxed disc and draws it away from the body, holding
it clipped between the ends of the first and second
fingers, the left thumb pressing the thread
against the cloth top of the tramway, and acting for
the time being (and indeed throughout the trick)
as a brake neutralising at pleasure the pull of the
weight.</p>

<p>He receives the coin on the tramway; then picking
it up with the right hand, makes some observation
as to the mark, meanwhile pressing the
waxed side of the disc against it, then replacing it,
disc down, in the middle of the tramway.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>“I shall now, by means of the ‘od’ force, compel
the coin to move towards me.” This he does
accordingly, by relaxing the pressure of the thumb
upon the thread and merely bringing the pull of
the weight into operation. When the coin has all
but reached the nearer end of the tramway, he says,
“We will now see if we can make it travel a little
longer distance.” So saying he draws the thread
out again and lays the coin on the farther end of
the tram, and again makes it travel slowly back.
A good effect may be here produced by making it
stop halfway, and (after remarking in a casual
way that the power is hardly strong enough) picking
up the ball, again rubbing it upon the sleeve
and moving it, a few inches distance, in the direction
in which the coin is to travel, when it resumes
its journey accordingly.</p>

<p>Once more picking up the coin, he replaces it at
the farther end of the tramway, but in so doing
passes the thread outside and around the screw at
that end. He then remarks, as if bethinking himself:
“By the way, a lady suggested the other
night that the coin was attracted towards me by
my personal magnetism. I know I am an attractive
man: I have been told so frequently but that
is not the explanation in this case, as I will prove
to you by making the coin travel <i>away</i> from me.”
So saying, he draws the coin towards him, easing
off the pressure on the thread to enable him to do
so, and leaves it at the inner end. The ball is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
now moved away from himself, and the pressure
of the brake being relaxed, the coin is now drawn
in the same direction.</p>

<p>“‘<i>Quod erat demonstrandum</i>,’ as our old friend
Shakespeare (or was it Euclid) used to say.” (To
the lender of the coin.) “You must take care of
this coin, Sir; it is now charged with a minute
quantity of the ‘od’ force, and so long as you
keep it you can never be ‘stony-broke.’ I will show
you just one more effect with it before I return it to
you.”</p>

<p>While speaking, he has carelessly picked up the
coin, and replaced it on the <i>inner</i> side of the screw
so that this shall be no longer encircled by the
thread. Picking up the match box from the table,
he pushes out the “tray” portion with the forefinger;
then throwing aside the outer case, he picks
up the tray, and inverts it over the coin.</p>

<p>“I will now show you that the ‘od’ force still
operates even though it is cut off from any direct
connection with the subject of the experiment: but
in this case a little more power is required.” So
saying he rubs the glass ball again on his coat-sleeve,
and, moving the ball accordingly, causes the
coin to travel towards him, the match-box naturally
moving with it. In again picking up the coin,
to return it to the owner, he detaches it from the
disc, which flies back to its original resting-place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE MYSTERY OF THE THREE SEALS</h3>

<p>This is a trick involving some little trouble in
the way of preparation, and perhaps a little more
than average address on the part of the performer,
but on the other hand it costs little; for all the
needful appliances may be homemade, and in the
hands of an expert the trick will amply repay the
time and trouble expended upon it. Baldly stated,
its effect consists in the magical introduction of a
marked coin into the innermost of a nest of three
envelopes, each securely sealed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 135px;">
<img src="images/figure36.jpg" width="135" height="200" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 36</span></p>
</div>

<p>The requirements for the trick are as under:</p>

<p>1. Two nests of envelopes. The innermost of
each is one of the little square kind used in shops
to contain copper “change,” or to hold the weekly
wage of an employee. It should be of cartridge or
stout manila paper, and about two inches square.
The next larger is of the ordinary square or so-called
square-note size, and the third a little larger
still. Envelopes of the two last mentioned sizes
are not always to be obtained made of cartridge
or manila, but this condition is not in their case
absolutely essential. The flap of each envelope
must be stuck down and sealed with red wax.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>2. A special envelope, which we will call the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
“trick” envelope. This is of the same size and
kind as the innermost of the nested envelopes but
has undergone special preparation as follows:
Taking two ordinary envelopes, cut round the
edges of one of them with a penknife, completely
dividing back from front. Take the plain or non-flap
side of the one so treated, lay it squarely under
the flap of the other, and stick the flap down upon
it in the ordinary way: then add a seal of red
wax, as closely as possible corresponding in appearance
with the two seals of the innermost of the
nested envelopes. Lastly, cut away the superfluous
paper round the seal and the edges of the
flap. The envelope will now be shown as in Fig.
36, and when closed will have the appearance of
an envelope sealed in the ordinary way, though it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
as yet lacks the connecting medium for actually
securing it.</p>

<p>3. The “coin mat” (<a href="#Page_4">page 4</a>) freshly treated
with the usual adhesive. The side so treated is to
be turned downwards on the table with a shilling
pressed against the adhesive portion.</p>

<p>4. A penknife, to be used as envelope opener.</p>

<p>As shortly as possible before the presentation of
the trick, the trick envelope must be further prepared
by spreading a thin layer of seccotine on that
portion of the underside of the flap immediately
under the seal.</p>

<p>N. B. This must not be done too long beforehand,
as it is essential to the success of the trick
that the envelope be used while the seccotine is still
in a “tacky” condition.</p>

<p>The envelope prepared as above, to be laid on the
table, behind some small object, or preferably just
inside the foremost rim of a Japanese tray; at one
corner, mouth uppermost, and flap to the rear.
Under these conditions, the butting of the opposite
edge of the envelope against the forward wall of
the tray will be found greatly to facilitate the subsequent
introduction of the borrowed coin. Before
so placing the envelope, its edges on each side
should be pressed slightly inwards, so as to make
it expand a little at the opening.</p>

<p>These arrangements duly made, the performer
may introduce the trick as follows:</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether anybody here remembers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
George the Third, I can’t say I do myself. He
was before my time, but there is a funny little story
told about him. One day when out for a walk, he
went into a farmhouse where he found the family
having their dinner. One dish consisted of apple-dumplings,
and the question crossed the King’s
mind, ‘How on earth did the apples get into the
dumplings?’ He didn’t like to ask, but he
couldn’t get the puzzle out of his head. He
thought about it so much and it worried him so
that at last he went clean out of his mind. He
became <i>non compos mentis</i>, which is the doctors’
polite way of saying dotty.</p>

<p>“I mention this story by way of a caution. What
I am going to show you is ever so much more incomprehensible
than any number of apple-dumplings;
in fact, so extra-extraordinary that if anybody here
was the least bit excitable and I sprung it upon
him unawares he might go dotty like old Georgie.
So if any of you feel at all nervous, don’t hesitate
to go home, or you can go and sit on the stairs
till this particular experiment is over. Nobody
moves! I am pleased to find that you are all so
strong-minded, but if anything happens don’t
blame me.</p>

<p>“I have known strong men; men of massive intellect,
like myself, come here with a smile on their
faces, but when they left the smile was replaced by
an air of grim determination. You could see at
a glance that they had made up their minds to find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
out how it was done, or <i>die</i>. They haven’t come
again: so I suppose they died.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>“As you are prepared to run the risk I will ask
some gentleman to oblige me with the loan of a
shilling, marked, in some unmistakable way.
Thank you, Sir. You have marked the coin?
Then please place it here, on this little tray. I
won’t touch it myself at present. All please keep
one eye upon it, the other eye you had better keep
on me.”</p>

<p>Receive the coin on the mat, held in right hand.
After showing the left hand empty, transfer the
mat to that hand and show the right empty.
Return the mat to right hand, but before doing so
turn that hand over so as to receive the mat with
thumb undermost. Just as you reach the table
to place the mat upon it bring the second and third
fingers over the borrowed coin, and under cover
of your own body turn the mat over. In putting it
down on the table draw away the borrowed coin
into the hand and palm it. To the eye of the spectator
the state of things will be unaltered, your
own coin, now uppermost on the mat, being taken
for the borrowed one.</p>

<p>You continue, standing behind your table, and
resting the right hand, with the palmed coin, close
to the trick envelope, and holding up the two nests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
in the other hand: “I have here two envelopes,
or, to be exact, six envelopes, for each of those you
see contains two more, one within the other: all
carefully sealed. I am going to pass the coin this
gentleman has lent me into the innermost of one
or other of them, I don’t care which, for they are
exactly alike, so I shall leave the choice to yourselves.”</p>

<p>While you are speaking as above the disengaged
hand slips the genuine coin into the trick envelope,
closes it, pressing the flap well down, and palms it,
dropping it a moment or two later into a pochette
till needed.</p>

<p>“You decide for this envelope? Just as you
please. As the other will not be needed I will ask
somebody to open it, and bear witness that things
are exactly as I have stated.”</p>

<p>Leaving the chosen envelope on the table in full
view and bringing forward the other, have the latter
opened by some member of the company with
the penknife. Hand the envelope produced from
it, with the knife, to a second spectator, to be dealt
with in like manner. When the innermost is
reached, have this opened by the lender of the
marked coin: this apparent proof of good faith
tending to make him less critical when, at a later
stage, he is invited to do the same with the trick
envelope.</p>

<p>“Nothing could be fairer, could it? You will all
agree that it would have been impossible to introduce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
anything into the innermost of those three
envelopes without breaking all three seals. When
I say impossible, of course I mean impossible to a
mere man. To a magician there is no such word as
impossible, except in the dictionary. In fact, the
more impossible a thing is, the more any respectable
magician makes up his mind to do it. Watch
me carefully, please. I want you to be quite sure
all through that there is no deception.</p>

<p>“Now then, to pass the coin into this other envelope.”
As you say this, you pick up the coin mat,
depress it enough for all present to see the coin
upon it, and make the motion of sliding it off into
the left hand. This should be done while standing
a little in front of your table. In turning to
replace the mat, reverse it and lay it with the side
to which the coin adheres downwards. If deftly
executed, this reversal of the mat will be imperceptible,
as it is covered by the turn to the table.
Even if it were noticed it would have practically no
significance for the spectators, who naturally take
it for granted that the coin has passed from the
mat into your hand. The moment you have laid
down the mat, the now disengaged hand picks up
the nest of envelopes, and you make believe to rub
the coin (supposedly in left hand) into it. This
done, you hold the envelope aloft in each hand
alternately, allowing it to be seen that the hands
are otherwise empty.</p>

<p>“So far, so good! The coin has passed from my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
hands into the innermost envelope. But I don’t
expect you to take my word for it. Will you, sir”
(any given spectator) “open the outermost envelope,
first, however, satisfying yourself that it is still
securely sealed?”</p>

<p>It is just possible, though not very likely, that
the person to whom the envelope and penknife have
been handed may notice, and remark audibly, that
he cannot feel any coin in the envelope. If such a
remark is made, you reply that the coin naturally
had to be dematerialised before it could pass into
the envelope, and it will take a few minutes for it
to re-materialise, but it will become gradually more
solid, and will then be distinctly perceptible.</p>

<p>The outer envelope having been opened you take
back its contents, and under pretext of getting as
many witnesses as possible to fair play, have the
next envelope opened by a second person, seated
at some little distance from the lender of the shilling.
The last named gentleman is invited himself
to open the last envelope, or rather, the trick envelope,
which you in transit substitute for it. Having
already opened a precisely similar envelope, and
found it securely fastened, he is not likely to anticipate
anything different about this one. If he uses
the penknife and cuts it open along the edge of
the flap in the usual way he will naturally hold it
with the thumb upon the seal and all will be well.
As a rule, he will be more concerned to identify the
coin as the one he lent than to seek for any suspicious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
feature about the envelope. Even in the
unlikely case of his tearing open the envelope,
instead of cutting it, it is doubtful whether he
would detect the use of the seccotine, which should
by this time be practically dry; and by the rest of
the spectators it would still be taken for granted
that this envelope, like the rest, was sealed in the
ordinary way.</p>

<p>It will be obvious to the expert reader that the
central idea, viz., the transformation by the use
of seccotine of an open envelope into one apparently
sealed in the regular way, is one that admits
of a wide variety of detail as to the mode of presentation.
For instance: The procedure suggested
for getting rid of the duplicate coin, and
apparently rubbing it into the envelope, is but one
of many alternatives. The coin might be
“passed” by the agency of fire, <i>i.e.</i>, wrapped in a
piece of flash paper with open fold at bottom and
flared off at the psychological moment over a candle
flame, or it might be got rid of by vanishing it into
the pocket of a black art mat, or by the use of a
black art patch, as described at <a href="#Page_20">page 20</a>.</p>

<p>The critical part of the trick is the “switching”
of the two envelopes at the final stage, but in view
of their small size this is a matter of very little
difficulty. The expert will probably do this after
some fashion of his own. The less instructed
reader may use the following plan, which he will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
find by no means difficult of execution, though it
will need some little practice to work it neatly.</p>

<p>While the second envelope is being opened, get
the trick envelope from the pochette into the right
hand, clipping it against the second and third joints
of the second and third fingers, with the “seal”
side turned away from them. When the genuine
envelope is handed to you receive it with the left
hand, and immediately transfer it to the right,
pushing it between the fingers and the palmed one,
with the seal facing in the same direction. The
moment it is masked by the fingers push the trick
envelope outward with the thumb, bringing this
into view in its place. Smartly executed the
change is instantaneous and cannot possibly be
detected. The apparent object of passing it from
hand to hand is to have the left hand empty and
so free to take back the penknife from the last
holder. From this point all will be easy, as it
is the trick envelope which is now alone in view,
and all you have to guard against is any accidental
exposure of the one now hidden in the hand.</p>

<p>This description may justly appear somewhat
long-winded, but its length is occasioned by the
number of small details demanding notice. In
performance, the trick should not take, at most,
more than ten minutes. The introductory patter
may of course be shortened at pleasure.</p>

<h3>THE WIZARD’S POCKETBOOK</h3>

<p>This is an extremely small volume, consisting
in fact of six pages only, and no letterpress, the
instructions for its use being embodied in a separate
leaflet. On each of its pages are miniature
reproductions of thirty-six playing cards, six in a
row; every card of the pack being represented once
at least among the whole number. The object of
the book is to enable the owner to discover the
name of a card drawn (or merely thought of) by
some member of the company. The chooser is
only asked to look at the book, and state on which
one or more of its pages the card in question
appears, when the performer, without seeing or
handling the book himself, can instantly name the
card. The six pages of the book are reproduced
in the diagrams which follow. Figs. 37-42.</p>

<p>To be in a position to work the trick, it is necessary
in the first place to memorise each of the fifty-two
cards of the pack in connection with a particular
number. This may at first sight appear a formidable
undertaking, but it is not so in reality.</p>

<p>All that really needs to be memorised is the order
of the suits; which is as under:</p>

<ul>
<li>1. Clubs.</li>
<li>2. Hearts.</li>
<li>3. Spades.</li>
<li>4. Diamonds.</li>
</ul>

<p>This order may be instantly recalled by using as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
a memory-peg the word <i>CH</i>a<i>S</i>e<i>D</i>, which contains
the initials of the four suits in the proper order, or
the reader may if he prefers it recall them by
reflecting that <i>Cool Heads Soon Decide</i>.</p>

<p>The arrangement of each suit follows the natural
order, the ace of clubs being No. 1; the deuce 2;
and the trey 3; knave 11; queen 12 and king 13.
The card next following, viz., the ace of hearts, will
be 14; the deuce of hearts 15, and so on, the complete
arrangement being as shown below:</p>

<ul>
<li>1. Ace of clubs.</li>
<li>2. Deuce of clubs.</li>
<li>3. Trey of clubs.</li>
<li>4. Four of clubs.</li>
<li>5. Five of clubs.</li>
<li>6. Six of clubs.</li>
<li>7. Seven of clubs.</li>
<li>8. Eight of clubs.</li>
<li>9. Nine of clubs.</li>
<li>10. Ten of clubs.</li>
<li>11. Knave of clubs.</li>
<li>12. Queen of clubs.</li>
<li>13. King of clubs.</li>
<li>14. Ace of hearts.</li>
<li>15. Deuce of hearts.</li>
<li>16. Trey of hearts.</li>
<li>17. Four of hearts.</li>
<li>18. Five of hearts.</li>
<li>19. Six of hearts.</li>
<li>20. Seven of hearts.</li>
<li>21. Eight of hearts.</li>
<li>22. Nine of hearts.</li>
<li>23. Ten of hearts.</li>
<li>24. Knave of hearts.</li>
<li>25. Queen of hearts.</li>
<li>26. King of hearts.</li>
<li>27. Ace of spades.</li>
<li>28. Deuce of spades.</li>
<li>29. Trey of spades.</li>
<li>30. Four of spades.</li>
<li>31. Five of spades.</li>
<li>32. Six of spades.</li>
<li>33. Seven of spades.</li>
<li>34. Eight of spades.</li>
<li>35. Nine of spades.</li>
<li>36. Ten of spades.</li>
<li>37. Knave of spades.</li>
<li>38. Queen of spades.</li>
<li>39. King of spades.</li>
<li>40. Ace of diamonds.</li>
<li>41. Deuce of diamonds.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>42. Trey of diamonds.</li>
<li>43. Four of diamonds.</li>
<li>44. Five of diamonds.</li>
<li>45. Six of diamonds.</li>
<li>46. Seven of diamonds.</li>
<li>47. Eight of diamonds.</li>
<li>48. Nine of diamonds.</li>
<li>49. Ten of diamonds.</li>
<li>50. Knave of diamonds,</li>
<li>51. Queen of diamonds.</li>
<li>52. King of diamonds.</li>
</ul>

<p>The arrangement of the table being once understood,
the number associated with any given card
in the club suit suggests itself automatically, <i>e.g.</i>,
the seven of clubs is likewise No. 7 in the list. To
ascertain the name of the card corresponding to
any of the higher numbers, all that is needed is to
subtract from that number 13, or such higher multiple
of thirteen as the case will admit, and the
difference will represent its position in its own
suit.</p>

<p>Suppose, for instance, that the performer desires
to know what card answers to the number 20.
Deducting thirteen from 20, the remainder, 7, tells
him that the card is the seventh (<i>i.e.</i> the seven)
of the second suit, viz., hearts. If he wants to
know the name of No. 29, he deducts 26, when the
remainder, 3, tells him that the card is the three of
the third suit, spades. If the card be No. 40, the
number to be deducted will be 39, and the
remainder, 1, tells him that the card is the first
of the fourth suit, viz., the ace of diamonds. After
a very few trials, this little exercise in mental
arithmetic becomes so familiar that the calculation
becomes practically instantaneous.</p>

<p>Going a step further; with each of the six pages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
of the pocket-book is associated a special number,
known as its “key” number. These are as under:</p>

<table summary="The key numbers">

    <td class="tdr">32</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The memorising of these is also a very simple
matter, for it will be noted that the key numbers
are the first six factors of the familiar geometrical
progression, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32. Printed as below:</p>

<table summary="Memorising the key numbers">

<p class="noindent">the upper figures, in ordinary type, expressing the
numbers of the pages, and the lower, in black type,
the corresponding key numbers, a very small
amount of study will associate them so closely in
the mind as to fix them firmly in the memory.</p>

<p>Having mastered these two simple lessons, the
learner is in a position to use the pocket-book. To
ascertain the card chosen, he has only to add
together the key numbers of the pages in which
he is told that such card appears. The total will
be the number at which that card stands in the list
given on <a href="#Page_185">page 185</a>, and, this being known, it becomes
an easy matter to name the card itself.</p>

<p>We will suppose, for instance, that performer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
is told that the chosen card appears on the second
page, and no other. The key number of this page
being 2, the card must be the second in the list, viz.,
the deuce of clubs. If he is told that the chosen
card is to be found on pages 1, 3 and 6: the key number
of these three pages being 1, 4 and 32: together
making 37, and thirty-seven less twenty-six being
eleven, he knows that the card must be the eleventh
of the third suit, otherwise the knave of spades.
If he is told that the card is on the third, fifth and
sixth pages, the key numbers of which are 4, 16 and
32, total 52, it is clear that the card must be the
last in the list, viz., the king of diamonds.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>So much for the working of the trick. But the
reader, if of an enquiring mind, will naturally ask,
“How is this result obtained?” The answer rests
upon a special property of the geometrical progression
which forms the six key numbers. It is
a curious fact that by the use of these six numbers,
either singly or in combination with others of the
series, any number, from unity up to 63, can be
expressed. Thus, the numbers, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and
32 we already have, these being numbers of the
series. As to other numbers:</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">and so on throughout up to 52, which being the
limit of the pack, is the highest number with which
we need concern ourselves.</p>

<p>In making up the pages of the pocket-book,
advantage has been taken of this principle. A
given card is inserted on that page or pages (and
those only) whose key numbers, alone or added
together, correspond with the position which the
card holds in the list. Thus the ace of clubs
will appear on the first page (not because it is the
first card, but because the key number of that page
is 1) and on no other. The deuce of clubs, in like
manner, on page 2, the key number of that card
being two. The next card, the three of clubs, must
appear on page 1 and page 2, their key numbers
together amounting to 3. The process as to cards
standing at higher numbers is the same. Thus, the
ace of spades, being the twenty-seventh card, and
twenty-seven being the aggregate of 16, 8, 2 and 1,
will appear on the first, second, fourth and fifth
pages. Conversely, if the performer is told that
the card appears on the four pages last named, he
knows that it is the twenty-seventh card, <i>i.e.</i>, the
ace of spades. Any spaces remaining vacant on
the page after the whole pack has been dealt with,
are filled up by duplicates of cards already figuring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
<i>on the same page</i>, their appearing under these
conditions making no difference to the calculation.</p>

<p>I am indebted to an ingenious amateur, Mr.
Victor Farrelly, for the idea of a novel method of
using the pocket-book. Mr. Farrelly does not
offer of his own accord to show what can be done
with it, but keeps it in reserve, for use in a special
emergency. Every conjurer meets now and then
with the pig-headed person who absolutely declines
to have a given card forced upon him, and persists
in endeavouring to extract one from some other
part of the pack. Armed with the pocket-book, the
performer can set such a person at defiance, and
indeed get additional <i>kudos</i> from his objectionable
behaviour.</p>

<p>He cheerfully gives up the struggle, saying “You
seem to think, sir, that I wish to influence your
choice in some way. To prove the contrary, I give
the pack into your own hands. Shuffle it well.
Thank you. Now take from it any card you please.
Look at it, and put it in your pocket. You are
satisfied, I presume, that I do not know that card?
You are quite right. I have not the smallest idea
of it, but I shall discover it without the smallest
difficulty by a process of mathematical magic. I
have here” (producing pocket-book) “a little book
of six pages, on each of which thirty-six cards are
illustrated. Will you kindly see whether the card
you chose is represented among those on the first
page? Meanwhile I will divide the pack, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
please remember I have not touched since you
shuffled it yourself, into six portions, one for each
page of the book.” This is done, the six packets
being turned face down on the table.</p>

<p>We will suppose that the chosen card is not found
on the first page. “Then,” says the performer,
“this first packet will tell me nothing, and may be
disregarded. Now, for the second page, is your
card upon that? It is? Then I draw two cards
from the second heap, and turn up one of them.
And now for the third page. Do you find your
card there? You do? Then I take up three cards
from the third packet, and again turn up the last
one.”</p>

<p>We will suppose that the chosen card is not found
in either the fourth or the fifth page, but re-appears
on the sixth, whereupon six cards are counted off
from the corresponding packet, and the last of
them turned up. The performer has by this time
mentally added up the key numbers of the second,
third and sixth pages: viz., 2, 4 and 32, together
making 38, and knows therefrom that the card is
the thirty-eighth in the list, viz., the queen of
spades. He does not however at once display his
knowledge, but pretends to make a mental calculation
from the cards exposed upon the table, giving,
if he so pleases, and the cards lend themselves to
it, some fanciful explanation of his method. It
seems to me, however, that this last is a needless
elaboration. Personally, I should prefer merely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
to call attention by name to the cards exposed, and
say, “When these three cards appear in conjunction,
it is clear that the card drawn was the queen
of spades” (or whatever it may happen to be).
Any one deluded, as the majority will probably be,
into believing that you really infer the name of the
drawn card from those on the table, will be farther
from the real solution than ever.</p>

<h2 id="CONCERNING_PATTER">CONCERNING PATTER</h2>

<p>It will doubtless have been observed that I have
in the foregoing pages been somewhat lavish in
respect of patter. I have done so for two or three
reasons.</p>

<p>First, in order to enable the reader to form a
better estimate of the effect of the trick presented,
duly clothed and coloured, to the mind of the spectator.
A trick described, however minutely, from
the mere mechanical or technical point of view,
gives scarcely more idea of its actual effect than
the rough charcoal sketch of the artist does of the
finished painting. Secondly, because ready-made
patter, if the reader cares to use it, will save him a
considerable amount of trouble. My third reason
is more personal, namely, that it has been a labour
of love to do so. To my mind the devising of some
little bit of appropriate fiction to serve as introduction
to a trick is the pleasantest part of the
inventor’s work.</p>

<p>It may perhaps be thought that I have, in some
of the more ambitious tricks, been overliberal in
this particular. I remember thinking, after witnessing
a “show” by Dr. Lynn, a popular performer
of the last generation, that he had talked a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
great deal, and done very little, and that I had had
very little real magic for my money. On the other
hand, the loquacious doctor was always amusing,
and it must not be forgotten that to amuse, even
more than to puzzle, is the <i>raison d’être</i> of the modern
magician. It seems to me therefore quite
legitimate to use, to a reasonable extent, the art
of the <i>raconteur</i> to supplement that of the
magician.</p>

<p>If my own patter is in some cases found superabundant,
I have at any rate done my best to make
it amusing, and if the reader opines that I have not
paid sufficient regard to the late Mr. Ducrow’s celebrated
maxim, “Cut the cackle, and come to the
’osses,” he is quite at liberty to cut my cackle to
what he may consider more reasonable proportions.
No doubt, time would be saved thereby. If, for
instance, he were to cut out the little romantic
fictions with which I have introduced “The Miracle
of Mumbo Jumbo” and “The Story of the Alkahest,”
and start “right away” with the bare performance
of the trick, both could be exhibited in
little more time than I have allotted to either alone.
Which treatment is likely to give the greater satisfaction
to his audience, he must decide for himself.</p>

<p>Where the performer has the gift (for a “gift”
it undoubtedly is) of devising effective patter for
himself I am strongly in favour of his doing so.
Borrowed patter may be likened to a borrowed
dress-coat. It is never likely to be an exact fit, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
a “giant’s robe upon a dwarfish thief,” or the
reverse, cannot be expected to be a becoming garment.
Every man has, or should have, a style of
his own, and it is rarely good policy to imitate that
of somebody else. If a low comedy man were to
essay to play Hamlet, or a tragedian, however
eminent, were to try to give an imitation of Harry
Lauder, the result would be likely to be disappointing.</p>

<p>The reader, undertaking to write his own patter,
and desirous of making it just what patter should
be, will find counsels of perfection in “Our Magic,”
and the more nearly he can approach them the
better. As, however, all have not the good fortune
to possess that admirable work, I venture to indicate
what to my own mind seem to be the chief
points to be aimed at.</p>

<p>It is almost a commonplace to say that the main
object of patter is misdirection. As the term is
more usually applied, this means something said or
done midway in the course of a trick to draw away
the attention of the audience at some critical
moment, and to create what the French conjurers
call a “<i>temps</i>” <i>i.e.</i>, an “opportunity” for doing,
unnoticed, some necessary act. But misdirection
may very well start at an earlier stage than this:
in fact, well in advance of the actual execution of
the trick. Each trick should have some sort of
introduction, and the patter serving this purpose
should be such as to lead the mind of the hearer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
away from the true explanation of the marvel, and
to suggest, in a more or less plausible way, some
other, remote from the real one.</p>

<p>The suggested explanation may be either pseudo-scientific,
where possible based on some generally
accepted truth (and it is surprising what a long
way even a few grains of truth go in such cases); or
it may be downright “spoof,” delivered however
with due appearance of seriousness. The explanations
will naturally fall a good deal short of the
George Washington standard of truthfulness, but
the most tender conscience need not in such a case
have any scruples on the score of veracity. No
sane person expects truth in a fairy tale, and a
magical entertainment, from beginning to end, is
but a fairy tale in action. To put the matter in an
epigrammatic nutshell:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Truth is “a gem of purest ray serene,”</div>
<div class="verse indent1">A virtue always to be cultivated,</div>
<div class="verse">But such depends,&mdash;you’ll gather what I mean,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse indent1">On how you happen to be situated.</div>
<div class="verse">At home, abroad, wherever I may be,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">I tell the honest truth, and shame the d&mdash;&mdash;.</div>
<div class="verse">But when you ask to be deceived. Good gracious!</div>
<div class="verse indent1">You can’t expect me then to be veracious.</div>
<div class="verse">In that case only do I make exception,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And most deceive when vowing “no deception.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This function of patter, the leading away the
minds of the audience from the true explanation of
the puzzle offered them, may be materially assisted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
by the introduction, among the “properties” used,
of some object professedly essential to the trick,
but as a matter of fact having no real concern with
the effect produced. The audience take for
granted that it must have something to do with the
effect, or it would not be used, and are thereby led
away the more effectually from the actual explanation.
Numerous illustrations of the use of this
device will be found in the foregoing pages.</p>

<p>If, in the case of a given trick, the performer
is absolutely at a loss to produce a satisfactory
fable to introduce it, he may evade the difficulty
by stating that he is about to produce an effect for
which he cannot himself account, and inviting the
assistance of his audience in doing so.</p>

<p>The second function of patter is the calling of
the attention of the audience to matters which you
desire them to take note of, and to give opportunity
to do so. There is small credit to be gained
by changing the ace of clubs into the ace of hearts,
or making a given article pass invisibly from one
spot to another, unless the spectators have been
first made to realise the original state of things, and
they must be allowed <i>sufficient time</i> to do so. I
have more than once seen an otherwise brilliant
show spoilt by being rushed through at railroad
speed. The mind of the spectator had not been
allowed time to receive clear impressions. The
company in such a case disperses with a consciousness
of having had a rapid succession of surprises,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
but with only a cloudy recollection as to what they
were.</p>

<p>In devising, as is sometimes desirable, new patter
for an old trick, an endeavour should be made to
look at the effect from an entirely fresh point of
view, so as to make the trick practically a new one.
A remarkable instance of such a transformation is
furnished by an incident in the life of Robert-Houdin.
At one period of his career he was
entrusted by the French Government with a very
important mission. He was sent to Algeria, specially
charged to “astonish the natives,” and by
his greater wonders to destroy their belief in the
pretended miracles of the Aissoua.</p>

<p>Among other surprises, he decided to make use
of his “Light and Heavy Chest,” a chest which, as
the reader is doubtless aware, became at command,
by means of an electro-magnet in the pedestal on
which it rested, so “heavy” that the strongest man
could not lift it from its base. This trick, produced
at a time when the phenomena of electricity
were but little understood, has produced an
immense sensation at his Paris performances.
But the Master instinctively felt that the trick in
that shape would produce little or no effect on the
more primitive mind of the Arab. He would simply
have taken for granted some mechanical means
of holding down the chest, beyond his own comprehension,
no doubt, but by no means to be
regarded as miraculous. Robert-Houdin decided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
to change the mode of presentation altogether, and
to make the illusion no longer objective, but subjective.
He announced that by means of his magic
power he could take away the strength of the
strongest man, and render him weak as a little
child. The “chest” was in this case merely
brought forward in a casual way, as a convenient
object wherewith the assertion of the magician
could be tested. The strongest man in the company
was invited to come forward, and try whether
he could lift that little box. Of course he could,
and did; a child could have done the same. “You
lifted it because I permitted you to do so,” said the
magician. “But I take away your strength. Try
to lift it now!”</p>

<p>Again the athlete tries his strength, but now he
fails. With teeth set, and every muscle tense, he
strains, and strains, but in vain, and he has to confess
that the infidel wonder-worker has, for the
time, taken away all his strength. Here was a
wizard indeed!</p>

<p>In arranging your patter, be humorous if you
can, but if, like the gentleman we have all heard
of, you “joke with difficulty,” don’t force yourself
to be funny. That it is possible for a man lacking
humour still to be a great conjurer is proved by
the case of Hartz, who was notably deficient in this
particular, but by his excellence in other directions
won a place in the very first rank of his profession.
But if you cannot be humorous, at any rate be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
cheerful. Geniality of manner is one of the most
valuable assets of the conjurer. Above all, don’t
be nervous. You may say “I can’t help it,” but to
a great extent you can. It is largely a matter of
<i>will</i>. Start with the idea that all will go well, and
it will probably do so. On the other hand, a low-spirited
conjurer always makes a low-spirited
audience.</p>

<p>In any case, be sparing of puns, which have been
deservedly described as the lowest form of wit. A
single pun, if good enough (or bad enough) may
win a laugh, and score to your credit, but to pepper
an audience with verbal shrapnel in the shape
of puns is an outrage on good taste.</p>

<p>Passing to the third function of patter, the misdirection
of attention in the course of a trick, we
will assume that you have made a start in the right
direction at the outset, by suggesting some fanciful
explanation of the effect you intend to produce, so
that your audience, starting from wrong premises,
do not know the points at which their too close
observation would be inconvenient. The best way
of diverting their attention at one of these critical
points is obviously to attract it to some other direction.
A mere sentence, particularly if accompanied
by appropriate action, will suffice. Supposing,
to take an elementary instance, that the
performer desires to drop unseen into the profonde
from his left hand some small article for which he
has just deftly substituted a duplicate, now exhibited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
in the right hand, he has only to say, “Now I
want you particularly to keep an eye on this”&mdash;whatever
the article in the right hand may happen
to be. All eyes are for the moment, instinctively
drawn to the object in question, and in that moment
the deed is done. The artifice is ridiculously simple,
but it is effective, and it is on being fully prepared
with the right thing to say and do at the critical
moment that the success of a magical entertainment
largely depends. Careful rehearsal, preferably
before an expert friend, will furnish the
best hints as to the danger-spots in the working
of a trick, and how best to devise patter to meet
them.</p>

<p>A final word of advice&mdash;advice that has been often
given, but cannot be too often repeated if you
really aim to carry your audience with you. Never
lose sight of the fact that you are, in the words of
Robert-Houdin, “an actor playing the part of a
magician,” and take your office seriously. In particular,
never before an audience use the word
“trick,” which at once gives away all your pretension
to magical power. An actor never tells his
audience that he is an actor or that he is playing a
part. He does not call their attention to his
make-up, however excellent, or tell them that his
wig comes from Clarkson. On the contrary, he
does his best to make his audience for the time forget
that he is Hubert de Barnstormer, or whatever
his stage name may be, and to keep up the illusion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
that he is actually the person whom he represents.
The modern magician should do the same. If he
has enough of the true artistic spirit to imagine,
when he steps forward on the platform, that he <i>is</i>
a magician, and that his miracles are genuine, he
will go a long way towards producing a like impression
in the minds of his audience. Bearing this in
mind, describe what you propose to do as an
“effect,” a “marvel,” an “experiment,” or a
“phenomenon”; never by any chance as a “trick.”</p>

<p>It may be objected that I have myself repeatedly
used the obnoxious word in the course of the foregoing
pages, but that is another matter. This
book is written by a conjurer for conjurers: and as
between ourselves we are forced to admit, painful
though it be to do so, that our greatest miracles are
only tricks. But we need not tell the public so.
Logically-minded, persons know it well enough, if
they are allowed to think about the matter. Our
business is to make them, for the time, forget it.
A wise old Roman said: <i>Populus vult decipi:
decipiatur</i>. Your audience wish to be deceived; in
fact they have come together for that purpose. By
all means let them be deceived to the top of their
bent; and the first step towards effectually deceiving
them, is to persuade them, if possible, that there
is “no deception.”</p>

<p>The patter for a given trick, once composed, and
tested by a few performances in public, may
thenceforth, so far as the professional is concerned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
be left to take care of itself. It should automatically
improve with each of its earlier repetitions
as good wine improves in bottle. Faults will
correct themselves, and being made perfect by
practice, the performer will thenceforth be able to
“speak his piece” without effort, and devote his
whole energies to the actual working of the trick.</p>

<p>To the amateur, only performing on special occasions,
with perhaps considerable intervals between
them, I commend a plan from which I myself
derived great benefit, viz.: Write out from
memory the patter for each trick on the programme
a day or two before a coming performance.
After you have given your show, go through your
manuscript again carefully, noting and correcting
it in any point in which the patter failed to be exactly
right. The interpolation of a single sentence,
the transposition in point of sequence of two
movements, or the alteration of some trifling detail,
such as standing at a different angle to your table
at a given moment, may make all the difference between
partial failure and complete success.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="THE_USE_OF_THE_WAND">THE USE OF THE WAND</h2>

<p>Closely connected with the subject of patter is
the use of the wand, which in my own opinion cannot
be too sedulously cultivated. To the cases in
which the wand itself forms the prominent item
of the trick, I devoted a special chapter in “Later
Magic.” To these therefore I need not further
refer. More important, however, is the part
played by the wand from the point of view of general
utility.</p>

<p>In the first place, it is the only remnant of the
traditional outfit of the magician. Time was,
when the regulation costume of the wizard was a
sugarloaf hat, and a robe embroidered with highly
coloured mystic symbols. Such a robe is still worn
as part of their make-up, by Chung Ling Soo and
a few other Orientals, but the orthodox costume of
the latter-day wizard is ordinary evening dress.
The wand alone remains; the symbol and the professed
instrument of his mystic powers, and from
its traditional connection with magic, there is a
special prestige attached to it.</p>

<p>For these reasons alone it would be desirable to
retain the use of the wand, but apart from them,
its practical uses are many and various. One of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
the first difficulties of the novice, as he comes forward
to introduce himself to his audience, is to
know what to do with his hands. He can hardly
advance with hand on heart, within his vest, <i>à la</i>
Pecksniff. Held open, with arms hanging down
by the sides, the hands look too stiff, and to advance
with them in his pockets would hardly be good
form. By coming forward wand in hand, he
avoids these difficulties. The hand holding it automatically
assumes an easy and natural position,
and he ceases to think about the other. With the
wand held in the right hand across the body, its
free end resting on the palm of the opposite hand,
he is in an ideal attitude for delivering his introductory
patter. Later on, by holding the wand in
the hand, he effectually disguises the fact that he
has some object, a card, a coin, or a watch concealed
therein. If he has occasion to call attention
directly to any object, the wand forms the most
natural pointer. If he finds it necessary, for some
reason connected with the trick in hand, to make
a turn or half-turn away from the spectators, the
fact that he has left his wand upon the table affords
him the needful opportunity.</p>

<p>Lastly, if the wand is habitually used as the professed
instrument of a desired transposition or
transformation, a certain portion of an average
audience gradually becomes impressed with the
idea that there really must be some occult connection
between the touch of the wand and the effect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
produced. There is much virtue in what may be
called a magical atmosphere, and after the wizard
has proved his magical power by performing two
or three apparent impossibilities, the mind of the
spectator (though in his calmer moments, he
knows, or should know, better), is led to adopt in a
greater or less degree the solution “forced” upon
him by the conjurer. Habitual use of the wand,
with apparent seriousness, goes far to create the
desired atmosphere.</p>

<p>A good effect may be produced by “electrifying”
the wand now and then, by rubbing it with a handkerchief.
The main uses of electricity are so
widely known, and so little understood by the million,
that they are quite ready to give it credit for
still more marvellous possibilities.</p>

<p>My friend Mr. Holt Schooling, mentioned in
connection with <i>The Secret of the Pyramids</i>, finds
an additional use for the wand. He uses, not one
only, but half a dozen, of different appearance, each
credited with some special magical virtue. At the
outset of his show these are arranged horizontally,
one above another on pins projecting from a small
sloping blackboard. For each fresh trick the
wand professedly appropriate to it is brought into
action, the one last used being at the same time
replaced on the stand. The spectators do not suspect
that behind each top corner of the board is a
small servante, enabling the performer, under
cover of the change of wands, to change a pack of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
cards, or to effect some other substitution necessary
for the purpose of his next item.</p>

<p><i>Verbum sap</i>, by all means cultivate the use of the
wand, and for the sake of effect, let it be of an elegant
and distinctive character. An office-ruler or
a piece of cane would serve many of its mechanical
purposes, but would lack the prestige attached to
what is, professedly, the genuine article.</p>

<p>One of the most striking proofs of the extensive
use and appreciation of the wand by modern
magicians is furnished by the remarkable collection
of such implements got together by Dr. Saram
R. Ellison, of New York.</p>

<p>Dr. Ellison<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> is an eminent and popular physician,
whose ruling passion is wanting to know
things, particularly things that other people don’t
know. Such being his temperament, it goes almost
without saying that at an early period of his
career he became a Freemason. Having been duly
initiated into the mysteries of the ordinary lodge,
and learnt all it had to teach him, he still yearned
for “more light,” and accordingly worked his way
up step by step through intervening degrees in
masonry till he reached what is known as the
thirty-third degree, an order even more exclusive
than that of the Garter, and claiming to possess
secrets as to which the ordinary “blue” mason,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
even though he be a Past Grand Everything, knows
no more than the veriest outsider.</p>

<p>When in this direction there were no more mysteries
left for him to conquer, Dr. Ellison naturally
turned his attention to Magic: and in accordance
with his habitual determination to know all
that there is to be known with regard to his hobby
for the time being he began to collect books upon
the subject. At first there were but few to collect,
but the literature of magic has grown, and grown,
and side by side with its advance Dr. Ellison’s collection
has grown larger and larger till it numbers
some hundreds of volumes. Harry Kellar, the
dean of American magicians, and himself an
enthusiastic collector, yearned to possess it, and
offered the doctor for it the handsome sum of two
thousand dollars, equivalent in English money to
about four hundred pounds. But Dr. Ellison was
not to be tempted. In order that the collection
should be preserved intact, he donated it, some
years ago, to the New York Public Library, also
providing a fund for its upkeep and further development.</p>

<p>But Dr. Ellison’s interest in, and services to
Magic did not end here. He has made a collection
of models, entirely the work of his own hands, of
the appliances for over sixty stage illusions.
Some are of full size, others quite miniature
affairs, but one and all exact to scale. Further, the
doctor has a special affection for souvenirs of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
famous magicians, past and present, especially in
the shape of wands, as being the most characteristic
possession of the wizard. Accordingly, some
years ago, he began to collect wands, and he now
possesses more than eighty such, each a wand which
has been habitually yielded by some more or less
famous magician. By the courtesy of Dr. Ellison
I am enabled to furnish particulars of some of
them; as given in a very interesting pamphlet by
Epes W. Sargent, a well-known American writer.</p>

<p>The catalogue commences with a wand formerly
belonging to Professor Anderson, the once famous
“Wizard of the North.” Here are found also the
wands used by the two Herrmanns (Carl and
Alexander), Buatier de Kolta, Lafayette, Martin
Chapender, Carl Willmann and others who tread
the stage no more. As regards the living, there is
here a memento of nearly every English-speaking
conjurer of note: besides many others of cosmopolitan
celebrity.</p>

<p>The wand here exhibited is not always the conventional
ebony and ivory affair, some of the specimens
being indeed of a highly original character.
For instance, the wand contributed by a Hindu
magician consists of the leg bone of a sacred monkey
from the temple of Hanuman, the monkey
god, at Benares. The wands of Madame Adelaide
Herrmann and Chung Ling Soo take the shape of
fans. Horace Goldin’s is a cut-down whip-handle,
and those of Clement de Lion and Imro Fox are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
portions of one-while walking-sticks, promoted to
a nobler use. Mr. J. N. Maskelyne’s “wand” is
an ordinary file, which, from the inventor point of
view, he regards as the greatest of wonder-working
appliances.</p>

<p>My own contribution may claim to be of exceptional
interest, not merely as being in itself a curio,
but as a memento of a very remarkable man, so
remarkable, indeed, that a brief notice of his career
may be interesting. It was presented to me by
Professor Palmer, a gentleman who was not, like
myself, a bogus professor, but the real thing, and
withal an exceptionally eminent man. Skill in
sleight-of-hand was the least of his accomplishments.
He had a marvellous gift of tongue, there
being scarcely a European or Oriental language
with which he was not thoroughly familiar. He
was born at Cambridge in 1840, and from his
earliest years showed indications of his peculiar
gift for acquiring languages. As a school-boy he
made friends among the gipsies, and learned to
speak their queer language so perfectly as to
deceive even those to whom it was their native
tongue. In later life it was a favourite joke of his
to saunter, in company with his equally accomplished
friend, Leland, into some gipsy encampment
where they were not known, and after paying
their footing by having their fortunes told,
to ask some of the nomads gathered round the fire,
to talk a little Rommany for their benefit. Gipsies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
are chary of speaking Rommany except
among their own people, and the inquisitive strangers
were frequently told that there was no such
language; whereupon, one of them would turn to
the other, and in purest Rommany quietly express
an opinion that their temporary hosts were not
thorough-bred gipsies, but of some inferior stock.
This produced Rommany in plenty, and the visitors
were energetically taken to task for that,
being themselves gipsies, they should ape the dress
and manners of the Gorgio. A friendly explanation
made all end happily.</p>

<p>Palmer made his first start in life as a clerk in
the City of London, where in his spare time he
made himself master of French and Italian. A
little later he took up the study of Persian, Arabic
and Hindustani, and speedily conquered them.
In 1867, after taking his degree at the University
of Cambridge, he was elected a Fellow by his College,
an honour conferred on him in recognition of
his mastery of the Oriental languages. During
the years 1868-1870 he was employed on behalf of
the Palestine Exploration Fund, to make a survey
of Mount Sinai, in the course of which he became
upon friendly and indeed almost brotherly terms
with many of the wild Arab tribes, among whom
he was known as the Sheikh Abdullah. As in England
he had been made free of the gipsy tent, so in
Palestine he could drop in upon many a Bedouin
encampment, and be sure of a hearty welcome.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
His skill in sleight-of-hand, which he had in the
first instance taken up merely as a pastime, proved
to be of immense service to him in his desert wanderings;
adding not only to his popularity but frequently
gaining for him the prestige of a genuine
magician, and thereby increasing his influence.</p>

<p>In 1871 he was appointed to the professorship of
Oriental languages at Cambridge, his official title
being the Lord High Almoner’s Reader of Arabic.
In 1882, in anticipation of the Arabi trouble in
Egypt, he was entrusted by the then Government
with the difficult and dangerous task of winning
over the Sinaitic tribes, and preventing the threatened
destruction of the Suez Canal.</p>

<p>His first trip, extending from Gaza to Suez, was
carried out successfully, but on penetrating farther
into the desert, he and his two companions, Captain
Gill, R.E., and Lieutenant Charrington, R.N.,
fell into the hands of a tribe to whom Palmer was
unknown, and were barbarously put to death.
Happily, their bodies were recovered, and received
from the nation the posthumous honour of burial
in St. Paul’s Cathedral.</p>

<p>The wand presented to me by Professor Palmer
is a curiosity in many ways. It is made of acacia
wood (the “shittim” wood of the Old Testament)
brought by Palmer himself from Mount Lebanon.
Around it, in spiral form, is inscribed an invocation
from the Koran, in Arabic characters. The
writing of the inscription is a genuine work of art,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
having been executed as a special favour to Palmer,
by Hassoun, an eminent professional
“scribe.”</p>

<p>I am reluctantly bound to admit that the Palmer
wand, in my hands, did not exhibit any special
magical virtues, and when I ceased myself to use
it, it seemed to me that it could not find a worthier
home than in Dr. Ellison’s fine collection.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Reverting for a moment to the subject of patter,
I will conclude by quoting, for the amusement
rather than the instruction of the reader, an oration
which (with variations) now and then formed
my introductory <i>boniment</i>, and might on occasion
still serve, in default of better.</p>

<p>“Ladies and Gentlemen, and members of the
Royal Family, if any happen to be present, I am
about to exhibit for your amusement, a few experiments
in Unnatural Philosophy, otherwise Magic.</p>

<p>“Magic in the olden times was a very different
thing, as I daresay you know, from what it is at
present. In those days every respectable wizard
kept a familiar spirit: a sort of magical man of all
work. He cleaned the boots and knives, and
when his master gave a show, it was the familiar
who worked all his miracles for him. The
magician only did the talking, and pocketed the
takings. But the familiar did much bigger things
than that. If his master’s next-door neighbour
made himself disagreeable, the familiar would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
hoist him up and drop him in the water-butt, or
into the Red Sea, according to order. If the
magician wanted a week at the seaside, he had no
need to pay railway fare. The familiar would just
pick him up, house and all, and land him gently in
the middle of the mixed bathing. The only drawback
was that, sooner or later, a time came when
there was no performance, because the magician
had been carried off by his familiar on a pitchfork.</p>

<p>“As the French say, <i>nous avons changé tout
cela</i>. Familiars are as extinct as the dodo. Perhaps
it’s as well, but it makes it very much harder
to be a magician. In the first place you must know
all about astrology, anthropology, Egyptology and
all the other ologies. You must be well posted in
mathematics, hydrostatics, pneumatics and numismatics.
You must know all about clairvoyance,
palmistry and thought reading, sympathy and
antipathy, magnetism, mesmerism, wireless telegraphy,
X rays and all the other kinds of rays.
Of course you must be well up in Greek and Latin,
and a little Hebrew, not to mention a few other
things which I forget for the moment, but I won’t
stop to think of them now. When you have studied
these little matters fourteen hours a day for
nine or ten years, you will be as ‘chock-full of
science’ as old Sol Gills himself, and you will be
able to do all sorts of wonderful things, some of
which I hope to show you this evening.</p>

<p>“Before I begin, there is just one little matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
I should like to mention. You hear people talk
about the quickness of the hand deceiving the eye.
I don’t know whether the quickness of the hand
ever does deceive the eye, but I want you to understand
that you must not expect anything of that
sort from <i>me</i>. I am naturally slow. I was born
twenty minutes after I was expected, and I have
been getting slower and slower ever since.</p>

<p>“To-night, I intend to do everything even more
slowly than usual: so that you will only have to
watch me closely to see exactly how it is all done.
Then, when you go home, if you do as I do, and say
as I say, without making any mistakes, no doubt
you will be able to produce the same results. If
not, there must be ‘something wrong with the
works.’”</p>

<p>Every conjurer who has in him, as all conjurers
should have, the creative instinct of the artist, and
aims therefore at putting something of himself
into his work, must of necessity be to some small
extent an amateur mechanic. The hints which follow
are addressed to the reader in that capacity.
I have no pretension to teach him how to do things
in the way of construction, but merely to make the
doing of them easier. Though relating to matters
in themselves small, the “tips” which follow may
safely be said to come within the scope of Captain
Cuttle’s celebrated counsel, “when found make
a note of.” It often happens that the amateur
mechanic has to take considerable trouble and
pains in procuring some special requirement,
while there is already on sale, at small cost, just
the thing he wants, if he only knew what to ask for,
and where to get it. The paragraphs which follow
will, in some at any rate of such cases, supply the
needful information.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>1. For woodwork on a small scale, an old cigar
box will often be found suitable material. Where
such a box is not available or not suitable for the
particular work in hand, what is called “three-ply”
may supply the need. This consists of three
layers of thin wood glued together under pressure,
with the grain of the intermediate layer running
crossway to that of the other two, the tendency
to warp being thereby greatly reduced. Drawing-boards
are, for this reason, now usually made of
wood so combined, and a drawing-board makes for
many purposes a good enough <i>extempore</i> work-bench.
For a finer class of work, the amateur
mechanic, if he is willing to take the trouble, may
make his own three-ply. For this purpose he
should procure a supply of what is called “knife-cut”
veneer, <i>i.e.</i>, thin sheets of walnut, mahogany,
satin,&mdash;or other hard wood, and glue them together
with the white glue to be presently described. Veneer
merchants form a distinct trade, and are comparatively
few in number, but the resident in London
can obtain veneer and thin woods of all descriptions
from Messrs. McEwan &amp; Son, 282 Old Street,
E. C. In country districts the shops which hold
agencies for “Hobbies” materials also sell planed-up
woods of various kinds, ranging like veneer
from one-sixteenth to half an inch in thickness.</p>

<p>2. As a handy substitute for glue, most people
are acquainted with the virtues of Seccotine, in its
way a most useful preparation. But there are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
many purposes for which Seccotine is too aggressively
viscous, while ordinary paste is not adhesive
enough. In such cases I can strongly recommend
<i>Pastoid</i>, a composition midway between glue and
paste. For all purposes for which paste (in small
quantity) is ordinarily used, Pastoid may be substituted
with advantage. I myself came across it
accidentally two or three years ago, “since when,”
like the gentleman in the soap advertisement, “I
have used no other.” The maker is Henry Roberts,
Middlesborough, but it should be obtainable
of any up-to-date stationer or fancy dealer. It is
supplied in glass jars, at sixpence and a shilling.</p>

<p>3. Where an actual glue, of fine quality, is
needed, procure sheet gelatine, to be had of any
grocer. Cut into small pieces and melt in an
ordinary gluepot using water enough to make the
resulting solution about as thick as ordinary gum
water. It should be used as near boiling point as
possible, and the joined surfaces left to dry under
the heaviest pressure available. A joint made with
this glue is practically invisible.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>4. For dividing up thin stuff (wood or cardboard),
into rectangular slabs, the handiest tool
is the “cutting gauge.” This is practically identical
with the better known “marking gauge,” save<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
that the “marker” is replaced by a little spade-pointed
cutter. This tool is only available for cutting
wood up to say eight inches in width, but to
the amateur attempting small work only, it will be
found invaluable.</p>

<p>5. For staining wood or cardboard a deep dead
black I have found nothing better than the “Record
Jet Stain,” manufactured by the Record Polish
Company, Eccles, Manchester. It is normally
designed for staining leather only, the makers not
having apparently realised its usefulness in other
directions. It is to be had of any dealer in leather
goods, in twopenny and sixpenny bottles. In
many cases I have found it best to rub it in with
a pad, rather than to apply it with a brush, but
this will of course depend largely on the nature
of the article to be treated.</p>

<p>6. An excellent polish for use after staining, or
for other purposes, is made by dissolving <i>white</i>
wax in turpentine, to the consistency of cream.
Applied sparingly, with plenty of friction to follow,
this produces a clean hard gloss, free from the
stickiness which is sometimes left after the use of
other polishes.</p>

<p>7. For enamelling small articles use Maurice’s
Porceleine (the makers of which are Walter Carson
&amp; Sons, Grove Works, Battersea, S. W.) procurable
at “oil and colour” men in tins from three-halfpence
upwards.</p>

<p>8. For any article to be made of flat card or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
mill-board, without folding or bending, preference
should be given to “Bristol” board, sold by artists’
colour-men. This is somewhat more expensive but
is stiffer and harder and has a better surface than
the commoner articles.</p>

<p>9. For joining wood to wood without glue where
there is no great thickness to be penetrated,
“needle-points,” procurable of any ironmonger,
will be found useful. These are stout eyeless
needles, of very brittle steel, about two inches in
length. To use them, bore with a fine bradawl a
hole partially through the wood, then drive in the
needle-point by gentle tapping with a hammer, and
when it has penetrated the desired depth snap off
all that remains above the surface.</p>

<p>10. Also useful for many purposes are what are
called by drapers “blanket” pins. These are of
brass, and a card of such pins in three sizes, ranging
from two to three inches in length and varying
proportionately in thickness, may be bought for a
penny. Pins a trifle shorter and thinner than the
above are known as “laundry” pins. Apart from
their normal uses, pins of these kinds are very
useful for bending into hooks, or to cut up into
short lengths of stiff straight wire for pivots or
otherwise.</p>

<p>11. For all effects dependent upon a thread pull
use, in place of ordinary thread, <i>plaited</i> silk fishing
line. This is procurable of any sports’ outfitter
or fishing tackle dealer, in twenty and forty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
yard lengths, and in half a dozen grades of thickness,
the finest being not much thicker than a hair
line. The breaking strain of this is much greater
than that of ordinary thread, and it has the further
advantage that being plaited instead of
twisted it does not unroll or “kink” in use. Allcock,
of Redditch, a name familiar to all anglers,
is a noted maker of such line, but he has no monopoly
of its manufacture. It is usually sold
white, but may be easily dyed any desired colour.</p>

<p>For this last valuable “tip” I am again indebted
to my often-quoted friend, Mr. Holt Schooling,
who, as an enthusiastic angler, is an expert as to
lines of all descriptions. The reader will find
numerous instances of the practical use of such
line in the earlier part of this book.</p>

<p>A good way of dyeing line is to thread a needle
on to one end, and pass it by the aid of the needle
through one corner, moistened with the appropriate
dye, of a soft sponge, and then back again
through the dry part of the sponge to clean off any
excess of moisture. When dry, if necessary,
repeat the process.</p>

<p>12. Square envelopes, for the purpose of forming
“nests” or otherwise, are now and then needed
by the conjurer, but envelopes precisely square
(save the small variety known as “pence” envelopes)
are not kept in “stock” by stationers in the
ordinary way. When such are needed the readiest
plan is to take an envelope of the long “bag” shape<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
and shorten it to an exact square, closing the lower
end as before. Envelopes of the above kind are
procurable in many varieties of paper, and in
widths ranging by various fractions of an inch
from four inches upwards.</p>

<p>13. To make a line, thick or thin, run freely over
a pulley-wheel or through an eyelet, use as a lubricant
powdered talcum, otherwise known as French
chalk. This is equally useful for minimising friction
between wooden surfaces, or between wood
and metal, say between a pulley-wheel and the
pivot on which it turns. Where the slight extra
cost is not an obstacle the use of ivory as the material
of a pulley-wheel secures the perfection of easy
running.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is, I trust, hardly necessary to say that wherever
I have mentioned an article to be had by purchase,
my recommendation is based solely upon
practical experience of its merits. I have no interest,
direct or indirect, in any of the articles mentioned,
and my knowledge of their manufacturers
is derived solely from their respective labels.</p>

<p>With these last lines I lay down my pen, as I
have long since laid down the wand. I do so with
regret, for writing about magic has always been to
me a labour of love, but failing energy and failing
eyesight warn me that my day is over, and that
“the night cometh, wherein no man can work.”</p>

<p>When I first began to discourse of magic, I had
the whole field, in a literary sense, to myself. That
state of things has long since ceased to be. Fertile
brains and ready writers have taken up my task,
and magic has now a worthy literature, growing
day by day. “So mote it be!”</p>

<p>Furthermore, if I may be allowed a word of advice,
let me say that every lover of magic, be he
professional or amateur, should join a magical society.
No great work can be carried forward without
organization, and the success of such bodies as
The Magician’s Club and the Magic Circle here,
and the Society of American Magicians over seas,
has proved that magic is no exception to the rule.</p>

<p>I must not close without a word of hearty thanks
to Harry Houdini, Oscar S. Teale and John W.
Sargent, of the Society of American Magicians, for
their generous offices in connection with the publication
of my book. With this last legacy to the
friends, at home and abroad, who have derived
pleasure or profit from my writings, I bid them
a cheery farewell.</p>

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
